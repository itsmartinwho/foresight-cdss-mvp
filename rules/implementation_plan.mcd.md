# Implementation Plan for Foresight CDSS MVP

## Project Overview
The Foresight Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) MVP will provide healthcare professionals with evidence-based recommendations for patient care. This implementation plan outlines the phased approach to building the MVP, including timeline, resource allocation, and key milestones.
