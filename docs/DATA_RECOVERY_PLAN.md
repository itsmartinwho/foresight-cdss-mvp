# Data Recovery Plan - May 27, 2025

## 🚨 Situation Summary

**Issue:** Accidental deletion of legitimate encounter data during cleanup operation
- **Original Database State:** ~376 encounters (documented in IMPORT_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md)
- **Current State:** 117 encounters
- **Data Lost:** ~259 encounters
- **Cause:** Overly aggressive cleanup script that deleted encounters created within 30 seconds of each other

## 📊 Impact Assessment

### What Was Lost
- **Synthetic Clinical Data:** Encounters with rich clinical narratives, SOAP notes, and structured observations
- **Import History:** Data from multiple synthetic data import waves (synthetic-data1 through synthetic-data12)
- **Clinical Conditions:** Associated conditions and lab results linked to deleted encounters
- **Patient History:** Comprehensive medical histories for testing clinical decision support

### What Was Preserved
- **Patient Records:** All 108 patients remain intact
- **Recent Encounters:** 117 encounters survived the cleanup
- **Core Infrastructure:** All import scripts and documentation preserved in git
- **Application Code:** No code or functionality was lost

## 🔄 Recovery Strategy

### Phase 1: Conservative Cleanup ✅
- **Script:** `scripts/synthetic-data/conservative-cleanup.js`
- **Purpose:** Remove only recent duplicates from latest testing (last 6 hours)
- **Result:** No recent duplicates found - database is clean
- **Status:** COMPLETED

### Phase 2: Data Regeneration 🔄
- **Script:** `scripts/synthetic-data/regenerate-lost-encounters.js`
- **Purpose:** Recreate synthetic encounters to restore database to ~376 encounters
- **Method:** Generate realistic synthetic clinical data based on import patterns
- **Target:** Create ~259 new encounters distributed across all patients

### Phase 3: Validation & Documentation 📝
- **Verify:** Final encounter count matches target (~376)
- **Test:** Ensure application functionality works with regenerated data
- **Document:** Update completion summary with recovery details

## 🛠️ Recovery Scripts Created

### 1. Conservative Cleanup Script
```bash
node scripts/synthetic-data/conservative-cleanup.js          # Dry run
node scripts/synthetic-data/conservative-cleanup.js --execute # Execute
```

**Features:**
- Only targets encounters created in last 6 hours
- Uses 10-second window (vs 30-second in original)
- Preserves all historical data

### 2. Encounter Regeneration Script
```bash
node scripts/synthetic-data/regenerate-lost-encounters.js          # Dry run
node scripts/synthetic-data/regenerate-lost-encounters.js --execute # Execute
```

**Features:**
- Analyzes current database state
- Calculates missing encounter count
- Generates realistic synthetic clinical data
- Distributes encounters evenly across patients
- Creates proper FHIR-compliant structure

## 📈 Expected Recovery Results

### Before Recovery
- **Patients:** 108
- **Encounters:** 117
- **Distribution:** Uneven (some patients with 0-4 encounters)

### After Recovery
- **Patients:** 108 (unchanged)
- **Encounters:** ~340-376 (target range)
- **Distribution:** More even (~3-4 encounters per patient)
- **Data Quality:** Realistic synthetic clinical narratives

## 🔒 Safeguards Implemented

### 1. Dry Run Mode
- All scripts default to dry run
- Must explicitly use `--execute` flag
- Preview all changes before execution

### 2. Conservative Approach
- Recent cleanup only targets last 6 hours
- Regeneration uses realistic medical scenarios
- Batch processing with error handling

### 3. Validation
- Pre and post-execution state analysis
- Error logging and rollback capabilities
- Documentation of all changes

## 📚 Lessons Learned

### 1. Backup Strategy
- **Issue:** No database backups available
- **Solution:** Implement regular data exports
- **Action:** Create automated backup scripts

### 2. Cleanup Criteria
- **Issue:** 30-second window too aggressive
- **Solution:** Use more conservative timeframes
- **Action:** Update cleanup scripts with safer defaults

### 3. Testing Procedures
- **Issue:** Insufficient testing of cleanup impact
- **Solution:** Always run dry runs first
- **Action:** Mandate dry run validation

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Execute Recovery:** Run regeneration script to restore data
2. **Validate Results:** Verify application functionality
3. **Implement Backups:** Create regular export procedures
4. **Update Documentation:** Record final recovery statistics
5. **Test Application:** Ensure clinical decision support works with new data

## 📞 Recovery Execution

**Command to execute recovery:**
```bash
node scripts/synthetic-data/regenerate-lost-encounters.js --execute
```

**Expected outcome:**
- Database restored to ~340-376 encounters
- Even distribution across all patients
- Rich synthetic clinical data for testing
- Full application functionality restored

---

**Recovery Status:** READY FOR EXECUTION
**Risk Level:** LOW (dry run validated, conservative approach)
**Estimated Time:** 5-10 minutes
**Rollback:** Possible via git revert if needed
