# Data Cleanup Report: Duplicate Encounters

**Date:** January 15, 2025  
**Issue:** Maria Gomez and Justin Rodriguez had hundreds of duplicate/empty encounters  
**Root Cause:** Infinite loop bug in "New Consultation" button  

## Problem Analysis

### Maria Gomez
- **Before:** 292 total encounters
- **Issue:** 290 empty encounters (99.3% were duplicates)
- **Root Cause:** 282 encounters created at exactly `2025-05-27T04:34` due to infinite loop bug
- **After:** 2 legitimate encounters retained

### Justin Rodriguez  
- **Before:** 176 total encounters
- **Issue:** 169 empty encounters (96% were duplicates)
- **Root Cause:** 161 encounters created at exactly `2025-05-27T11:50` due to infinite loop bug
- **After:** 7 legitimate encounters retained

## Investigation Process

1. **Created investigation script** (`investigate_duplicate_encounters.js`)
   - Analyzed encounter patterns by creation timestamp
   - Identified empty encounters (no reason_display_text, transcript, or SOAP notes)
   - Found massive duplicate groups created at identical timestamps

2. **Confirmed root causes:**
   - **Infinite loop bug:** "New Consultation" button created hundreds of encounters in seconds
   - **Empty records:** These encounters contained only timestamps and auto-generated metadata
   - **Timing correlation:** Creation times matched when the infinite loop bug was being debugged

## Cleanup Process

1. **Created cleanup script** (`cleanup_duplicate_encounters.js`)
   - Performed dry run to identify what would be deleted vs. preserved
   - Used conservative criteria: only delete encounters with NO content (no reason, transcript, or SOAP note)
   - Deleted in batches of 50 to avoid database overload

2. **Preserved legitimate encounters:**
   - **Maria Gomez:** 2 encounters with actual medical content
   - **Justin Rodriguez:** 7 encounters with actual medical content

3. **Successfully deleted:**
   - **Maria Gomez:** 290 empty encounters
   - **Justin Rodriguez:** 169 empty encounters
   - **Total:** 459 duplicate/empty encounters removed

## Verification

Post-cleanup verification confirmed:
- ✅ Maria Gomez: 2 encounters (down from 292)
- ✅ Justin Rodriguez: 7 encounters (down from 176)  
- ✅ No empty encounters remaining
- ✅ All legitimate medical encounters preserved with full content

## Scripts Created

1. **`investigate_duplicate_encounters.js`** - Analysis and investigation tool
2. **`cleanup_duplicate_encounters.js`** - Safe cleanup with dry-run capability

## Lessons Learned

1. **UI Bug Impact:** The infinite loop in "New Consultation" button created massive data pollution
2. **Data Validation:** Need better validation to prevent empty encounters from being created
3. **Monitoring:** Should implement alerts for unusual encounter creation patterns
4. **Cleanup Strategy:** Conservative approach preserved all legitimate data while removing pollution

## Recommendations

1. **Prevent Future Issues:**
   - Add rate limiting to consultation creation
   - Implement client-side debouncing for buttons
   - Add server-side validation for encounter content

2. **Monitoring:**
   - Add alerts for bulk encounter creation
   - Monitor for empty encounters being created
   - Regular data quality checks

3. **Data Integrity:**
   - Require minimum content for encounter creation
   - Implement soft deletes with audit trails
   - Regular cleanup scripts for data maintenance
