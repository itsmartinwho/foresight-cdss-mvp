Clinical Knowledge Sources for CDSS Integration
Oncology Guidelines and Treatment Protocols
* NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN) – Authoritative, regularly updated cancer treatment guidelines issued by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network. NCCN guidelines cover most tumor types and supportive oncology care. They are provided as detailed PDF documents (with decision algorithms) and carry version numbers and update dates (e.g. “Adult Cancer Pain v1.2024”). Availability: Free for individual use after (free) registration on NCCN’s website, but integration requires licensing – NCCN content is copyrighted and may not be reproduced or embedded in other systems without permission. NCCN offers a licensed developer API with content in XML/JSON for those who obtain an enterprise license. Format: Primarily PDF (human-readable), with structured data (XML/JSON) available to licensees. RAG-friendly: The textual content can be parsed (with permission) for retrieval-augmented applications, but direct use in a CDSS prototype is restricted unless licensed. Update frequency: At least annual updates for each guideline, with interim updates as needed for new evidence. For example, many guidelines have 2023–2024 versions. APIs: Yes – NCCN provides a paid API for licensed use, delivering guideline data in XML/JSON (updated whenever guidelines are updated).
* ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines (ESMO) – Internationally recognized oncology guidelines from the European Society for Medical Oncology. Issued as peer-reviewed articles (often in Annals of Oncology or ESMO Open) by expert panels, covering diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up for various cancers. Availability: Freely accessible (open access) – ESMO guidelines are intended to be “clear, easy to use and free to use” by the oncology community. Most guidelines are downloadable as PDFs; many are published under a Creative Commons CC BY-NC-ND license (free for non-commercial use with no derivatives). Format: PDF and HTML (journal websites); no official structured data, but content can be extracted or converted (e.g. to Markdown) for internal prototyping. RAG-friendly: Yes – the narrative text and recommendations can be vectorized once extracted. Updates: ESMO updates guidelines periodically (every few years or as new evidence emerges). Some fast-changing topics have “living guidelines” or interim updates. Each guideline cites its latest update year (e.g., a 2023 update for pancreatic cancer). APIs: No public API; content is retrieved via journal sites or ESMO’s portal (the latter may require a free account for full text).
* NCI PDQ Cancer Information Summaries (NIH/NCI) – High-quality evidence-based cancer knowledge base from the National Cancer Institute. PDQ (Physician Data Query) summaries cover adult and pediatric cancer treatment, screening, prevention, genetics, and supportive care. They are maintained by editorial boards and provide comprehensive, referenced overviews of oncology care (though PDQ is positioned as informational summaries, not formal “guidelines”). Availability: Completely free – funded by the U.S. government as a public resource. Content is accessible on the NCI website and via syndication. Format: HTML pages on cancer.gov (with sections and references) and downloadable in various formats. NCI’s content syndication program offers PDQ summaries in structured form (e.g. via a REST API that can return JSON or XML). For example, HHS provides a JSON syndication endpoint for PDQ summaries that can be used in applications. RAG-friendly: Yes – the text can be parsed or directly obtained via API for indexing. Updates: Continuously updated by NCI’s editorial boards. Many summaries are reviewed weekly or monthly as new evidence comes out; each includes a “Latest update” date. For instance, the PDQ summary on anal cancer was updated on Feb 12, 2025. PDQ provides an email alert for weekly updates, indicating frequent revisions. APIs: Yes – NCI offers a content syndication API (via HHS) to retrieve PDQ data in XML/JSON, ideal for integration. This makes PDQ a convenient source for a prototype (the structured data can be pulled and converted to Markdown or used directly in a retrieval system).
* NICE Oncology Guidance (NICE UK) – The UK’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence publishes cancer guidelines (e.g. on diagnosis, management, and referral for common cancers). These are evidence-based guidance documents often used in broader clinical practice. Availability: Freely available online – NICE guidelines can be read on the NICE website without charge. For integration, NICE offers a syndication service/API that is free for use within the UK NHS and for testing purposes (international use may require a license). Format: Content is provided as structured HTML web pages and downloadable PDFs. The NICE syndication API can deliver full guideline content as JSON or XML (as well as HTML/Atom feeds). RAG-friendly: Yes – NICE text is well-structured (sections, recommendations) and can be scraped or obtained via API for indexing. Updates: Periodically updated – each guideline lists its last updated date. For example, NICE guideline NG100 (Rheumatoid Arthritis) was published in 2018 and last updated in October 2020. Oncology guidelines are updated on varying schedules depending on new evidence (typically every few years). APIs: Yes – the NICE Guidance API (RESTful) returns guideline data in JSON/XML, which can be directly used to feed a CDSS. This makes NICE guidance a low-effort integration candidate (e.g. one could fetch the content and store it as static Markdown with metadata like publication and update dates).
Autoimmune Disease Diagnosis & Management Guidelines
* ACR Clinical Practice Guidelines (ACR) – Authoritative guidelines from the American College of Rheumatology for autoimmune and rheumatologic diseases (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, vasculitis). Developed by expert panels, these guidelines cover diagnostics and treatment (including use of DMARDs, biologics, etc.) in detail. Availability: Open-access – ACR guidelines are published in medical journals and often made freely available. For example, the 2021 ACR Guideline for Rheumatoid Arthritis treatment is marked “Free Access” by the publisher, and the full text PDF is available via ACR’s website. ACR also provides free PDF downloads of guidelines (and companion resources) on its site. Format: Typically PDF documents (from journals or ACR’s site). No structured data or API is provided; however, the PDFs can be converted to text/Markdown for internal use. Licensing: While free to read, the content is copyrighted (often by the journal or ACR). Non-commercial internal use is permissible, but any commercial or public integration would require permission. (ACR usually requests that organizations contact them for reuse of guideline content beyond personal use.) RAG-friendly: Yes – once the text is extracted, recommendations can be chunked and indexed for retrieval. Updates: Multi-year update cycle – ACR updates guidelines as new evidence accumulates, typically every ~5 years for major diseases. For instance, the RA guideline was updated in 2021 (previous update in 2015), and new guidelines (or revisions) are released for other conditions (e.g. ACR lupus nephritis guidance updated in 2020). APIs: None – integration would rely on manual download and parsing. In a prototype, one might manually convert the PDF to a structured Markdown with metadata (title, year, etc.).
* EULAR Recommendations (EULAR) – Guidelines and consensus recommendations from the European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (formerly European League Against Rheumatism) covering autoimmune conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, vasculitis, etc. Availability: Free – EULAR recommendations are published in journals (often in Annals of Rheumatic Diseases) and are usually accessible. Many are open access or at least have executive summaries freely available. EULAR often uses a “recommendations” format (with overarching principles and numbered recommendations). Format: PDF/HTML of journal articles. No official structured format, but each publication is well-organized (often includes tables of recommendations that could be extracted). Licensing: Content is © EULAR/the publisher. They are intended for broad use by clinicians, and EULAR guidelines are “free to use” for practitioners. For integration into a tool, one should respect the publisher’s terms (many are under a CC BY-NC license if open access). RAG-friendly: Yes – the textual recommendations can be parsed. Updates: Periodic – EULAR updates its recommendations every few years. For example, EULAR updated its RA management recommendations in 2019, lupus in 2019, etc., reflecting new therapies. APIs: None. Integration would involve downloading the guideline PDFs and transcribing key points into a structured format (e.g. a JSON with each recommendation and its grade, plus metadata like year and citation).
* NICE Guidelines for Autoimmune Conditions (NICE) – NICE in the UK issues guidelines on chronic autoimmune diseases (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis) which are relevant for both specialist and primary care settings. For example, NICE’s RA guideline (NG100) covers diagnosis, treat-to-target, pharmacological management, and monitoring. Availability: Free via NICE website/API – as with oncology, the full text is on the public site. Format: HTML and PDF; available via the NICE syndication API in structured form. RAG-friendly: Yes – content can be scraped or pulled via API for building an internal knowledge base. Updates: Vary by guideline; typically revisited every few years. (NICE RA was updated in 2020; other topics like psoriasis or MS have their own guidelines with last update dates noted on the site.) APIs: Yes (same NICE API as above). For a prototype, one could retrieve these and convert to Markdown with sections for each recommendation.
* NIH/NIAMS Resources – (Honorable mention) The National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS, NIH) provides educational resources on autoimmune and rheumatic diseases. While not formal guidelines, NIH consensus statements or clinical trial networks sometimes publish management guidance. These are all public domain (US Government) and could supplement clinical background. Formats: Web articles or PDF summaries on NIH websites. Note: For rigorous decision support, the professional guidelines (ACR/EULAR/NICE) are preferred, with NIH resources as adjuncts for background information.
Drug Interaction Knowledge Bases
* NLM RxNorm Drug Interaction API (NIH/NLM) – A freely accessible drug–drug interaction knowledge base provided via the National Library of Medicine’s RxNav APIs. This service aggregates interaction data from curated sources. Notably, it includes the ONCHigh-priority interactions list (a set of clinically critical DDIs identified by an expert panel) and data from DrugBank’s open dataset. The API allows querying by drug (using RxNorm identifiers) to retrieve known interactions. Availability: Free for public use (NLM). Usage of the API may require UMLS licensing (free with registration) or an API key. Format: REST API returning JSON. For example, a GET request to /.../interaction.json?rxcui=<drugID>&sources=ONCHigh,DrugBank returns a JSON payload of interactions. The data includes interacting drug pairs and often a short description of the interaction. RAG-friendly: Yes – the structured JSON is directly usable for a CDSS; one can index drug names or use vectors for interaction descriptions. Update frequency: Monthly – The interaction dataset is updated regularly (approximately monthly) to incorporate updates from DrugBank and ONCHigh maintenance. (Note: ONCHigh is periodically updated using CredibleMeds for QT prolongation interactions, and DrugBank releases periodic version updates). APIs: Yes – this is an API-centric resource. NLM’s RxNav Interaction API is the primary integration point. (As of 2025, NLM has announced potential changes to this service, but for a prototype it remains a readily available open API.)
* DrugBank Open Data – A comprehensive drug knowledge base (maintained by the DrugBank group in Canada) that includes drug interaction information. Availability: Partially free – DrugBank offers a *free *“open” version for research/non-commercial use under a CC BY-NC license. The open database can be downloaded (after registering for a free account) in XML or JSON format. It contains thousands of drugs with lists of known interactions for each. Format: XML (legacy format) and JSON (for recent versions) with structured fields (each drug entry has an “interactions” section listing other drugs and the nature of the interaction). RAG-friendly: Yes – the structured data can be parsed to create a vectorized knowledge base of drug interactions. The data is well-suited for building a RAG system, as one could embed textual interaction descriptions or just use it for lookup. Licensing: Non-commercial only – The free DrugBank data cannot be used in a product without a commercial license. For internal prototyping and testing, it is permissible under the research terms. Updates: DrugBank is updated a few times each year with new drug entries and interaction data. Each release is versioned (e.g., DrugBank v5.x); the non-commercial release typically lags the commercial by a short interval but is reasonably up-to-date. APIs: Yes (commercial) – DrugBank Inc. offers a paid API for commercial clients. However, for internal development, one would use the downloadable dataset. (Alternatively, one could query the NLM RxNorm API which is powered by DrugBank data for interactions, as described above.)
* FDA / NLM DailyMed (Drug Labels) – The FDA’s official repository of prescription drug labeling (DailyMed, provided via NLM) is a valuable open resource containing drug interaction information as part of each drug’s approved label. Every FDA-approved drug’s label includes a “Drug Interactions” section with detailed notes on interacting substances. Availability: Free and public domain – DailyMed is a public database. All drug label content is available for use (it’s submitted by manufacturers to FDA, thus not copyrighted). Format: Structured Product Labeling (SPL) XML, plus HTML and PDF renditions. One can download the entire set of labels or incremental updates (DailyMed offers daily, weekly, monthly archives). The SPL XML has coded sections (with specific identifiers for sections like Drug Interactions). For example, one could parse the XML to extract the text of the interactions section for each drug. RAG-friendly: Partially – While the data is free text (the interaction content is prose written in labels), it is obtainable in bulk and could be indexed. This is a less curated source – it may contain verbose text and overlapping information – but ensures comprehensive coverage of all approved drugs. For a prototype, one might use a subset or specific drug classes. Updates: Real-time – Label updates appear as soon as companies submit changes. It’s continuously updated; a full update file can be pulled monthly to sync all changes. APIs: Yes – DailyMed provides web services for querying labels (by drug name, ingredient, etc.) and returns data in XML/JSON. Additionally, openFDA’s API can be used to search label data by keyword (including interactions), though it returns sections of text rather than a structured interaction list. For quick integration, one might download a selection of SPL files and convert the “Drug Interactions” sections into a Markdown or JSON knowledge base.
* Other Notable Sources:
    * MedlinePlus Drug Information (NIH/NLM) – consumer-facing drug info that includes interaction warnings. It’s open access and in HTML/JSON via an API, but geared toward simpler language.
    * Clinical Pharmacology/Micromedex (Commercial) – not open access (license required) but widely used in hospital CDSS for interaction checking. (Mentioned here for completeness – for an open prototype, we stick to free sources.)
General Primary Care Guidelines and Knowledge Sources
In primary care domains (diabetes, cardiovascular, preventive health, infectious disease, etc.), the following credible and open-access sources are recommended. These are widely recognized, evidence-based guidelines that can be integrated into a CDSS prototype with minimal licensing barriers. For a quick prototype, one can obtain these as static documents (PDF/HTML) and convert to Markdown or JSON with metadata (title, source, date).
* ADA Standards of Care in Diabetes (ADA) – The American Diabetes Association’s annual Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes is the definitive guidance for diabetes management in primary care and endocrinology. Publisher: ADA. Availability: Free – published each year as an open-access supplement in Diabetes Care. The full text is available online and as PDF each January. ADA also provides an abridged version for primary care. Format: PDF and HTML; not inherently structured, but sections are clearly delineated (glycemic targets, therapy algorithms, etc.). RAG-friendly: Yes – one can split the text by section/recommendation. Update frequency: Annual – updated every year with the latest evidence and drug approvals. (For instance, the 2024 Standards were released in late 2023, and 2025 is expected in January 2025.) Licensing: ADA holds copyright, but the content is free for non-commercial use. Internal use in a prototype is permitted; for commercial integration, ADA would require permission. APIs: None publicly; one would manually incorporate this. Preferred format for prototype: convert the guideline into structured Markdown (with sections like “Glycemic Management”, “Blood Pressure Control” etc., plus recommendation bullets). This low-effort approach yields a self-contained knowledge base for diabetes care.
* ACC/AHA Cardiovascular Guidelines (ACC/AHA) – A collection of guidelines from the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association covering hypertension, cholesterol management, cardiovascular risk, heart failure, etc. These guidelines are considered gold-standard in cardiology and primary care management of CV risk factors. Availability: Freely available – ACC/AHA guidelines are published in journals like Circulation or JACC and almost always made open-access (the organizations want wide dissemination). For example, the 2019 ACC/AHA Guideline on Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease is available on PubMed Central. Format: PDF/HTML (with supplemental tables). RAG-friendly: Moderately – these documents are lengthy textual guidelines, but key recommendations are often summarized in tables or bullet points that can be extracted. Update frequency: Multi-year – each guideline is updated on a cycle (e.g. cholesterol guidelines in 2018, hypertension in 2017, prevention in 2019, heart failure in 2022, etc.). They incorporate major trial results, so timing is irregular but roughly every 5 years per topic. Licensing: Free to use for reference; content is copyrighted by ACC/AHA (often under a nominal reuse policy). For a CDSS prototype, quoting or summarizing the recommendations (with attribution) is acceptable. APIs: None. Integration approach: use static files. Many ACC/AHA guidelines have executive summaries that can be copied into a Markdown file, with metadata (title, year). These summaries contain the Class I/IIa/IIb recommendations which can feed a decision support logic or retrieval system.
* USPSTF Preventive Services Recommendations (USPSTF/AHRQ) – Authoritative guidelines on preventive care (screenings, counseling, prophylactic medications) from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. These cover topics like cancer screenings, diabetes screening, vaccinations (overlapping with CDC), etc., with letter grades for each recommendation. Publisher: USPSTF (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, US). Availability: Free/Public domain – all recommendations are published on the USPSTF website and in JAMA. Format: HTML summaries and PDF recommendation statements. Structured Data: The USPSTF provides a REST API (Prevention TaskForce API) that returns the recommendations in JSON format. This API can filter relevant recommendations based on patient parameters (age, sex, etc.), making it powerful for CDSS use. (API access requires a token request, but it’s free and they even encourage caching the JSON dataset for efficiency.) RAG-friendly: Yes – the JSON data can be ingested directly into a knowledge base. Each recommendation includes fields like population, recommendation summary, and grade, which can be turned into prompts or quick lookup entries. Update frequency: Continuous – the USPSTF releases a few new or updated recommendations each year. For example, new screening guidelines might be added multiple times annually. The API data is updated as soon as recommendations are published. Licensing: As a U.S. Government-funded work, these are in the public domain; integration poses no licensing issues. APIs: Yes – as noted, the Prevention TaskForce API is provided. Prototype tip: One could pull the entire recommendations list via the API (or from the JSON dataset they provide) and store it as a JSON file. This yields a ready-to-use, structured repository of preventive guidelines for a CDSS.
* CDC and ACIP Guidelines (CDC) – The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issues guidelines relevant to primary care, especially in immunizations and infectious disease prevention. Key resources include the CDC Immunization Schedules (updated annually for children and adults) and guidelines for management of diseases like sexually transmitted infections (e.g. CDC’s STD Treatment Guidelines). Availability: Free – CDC guidelines are government publications and open access (e.g. the immunization schedule PDFs and the STD guidelines in MMWR are freely downloadable). Format: Web pages, PDFs, and in some cases CSV (for schedules). For example, immunization schedules are available as PDF posters and also in interactive HTML on CDC’s site. RAG-friendly: Yes – though not always narrative text. The immunization schedule could be integrated as a table or logic rules. The textual guidelines (like STD treatment) can be parsed. Update frequency: Regular – immunization schedules update every year (every February for the new schedule); other guidelines (e.g. TB testing, COVID guidelines) are updated as needed. Licensing: Public domain (US Government). APIs: CDC itself provides some APIs for certain data (e.g. a FHIR API for immunization schedule is being piloted), but often integration is done by downloading static files. For a prototype: one could embed the immunization schedule as a static resource or use the CSV data from CDC’s repository. The STD treatment guideline (last updated 2021) could be stored as a Markdown document for quick reference in a CDSS.
* IDSA Clinical Guidelines (IDSA) – Guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America, covering management of infections (e.g. pneumonia, urinary tract infections, HIV (in conjunction with NIH/HIVMA), COVID-19, etc.). Availability: Open-access – IDSA guidelines are published in Clinical Infectious Diseases or Open Forum Infectious Diseases and made freely accessible on IDSA’s website. They are evidence-based recommendations developed via GRADE methodology. Format: PDF/HTML full texts. Licensing: The content is free to read, but for integration or redistribution, IDSA requests permission (as stated in their guidelines that any use of the content requires approval). For internal decision support or research, using the information is acceptable, but embedding large portions verbatim in a commercial product would need IDSA’s consent. RAG-friendly: Yes – the recommendations (often presented as numbered statements with strength of recommendation) can be extracted. Update frequency: Irregular – depends on topic; some IDSA guidelines are updated every ~5-10 years or when new treatments emerge. (E.g. community-acquired pneumonia guideline updated in 2019 after 12 years, new COVID guidelines were living documents updated frequently in 2020–2021.) APIs: None. Integration for prototype: Download the PDFs of a few key IDSA guidelines (e.g. pneumonia, skin/soft tissue infections, etc.) and transcribe salient recommendations into a knowledge base. Given that these are trusted, using them in a CDSS provides credible advice for infectious diseases.
* NICE and WHO Primary Care Guidelines – For a broad international perspective, the NICE guidelines (UK) cover many primary care topics (diabetes, hypertension, asthma, etc.) and are all freely accessible as discussed. Additionally, the World Health Organization publishes guidelines on various health topics (e.g. WHO hypertension guideline 2021, WHO diabetes guideline, etc.) which are open access. Format: Typically PDF. Use: These can be considered if an open global source is needed. For instance, WHO’s guidelines could be turned into static text for a prototype. However, in terms of ease of integration, the previously listed sources (ADA, ACC/AHA, USPSTF, CDC) are more directly relevant to everyday primary care in the US/UK context and are readily accessible.
Summary – Preferred Integration Formats: For a quick prototype CDSS, prioritize sources that provide structured or easily parseable content. The USPSTF API and NICE API stand out for providing JSON/XML data that can be ingested with minimal effort. The NCI PDQ and Drug interaction APIs (RxNorm) also supply structured JSON data. Where only PDFs/HTML are available (ADA, ACC/AHA, ACR, etc.), a practical approach is to convert those documents into Markdown or JSON with each guideline’s key points and metadata (title, publisher, last update). This yields a collection of static files that can be loaded into a Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline for the CDSS. All the above-mentioned sources are widely recognized and evidence-based, and most are free for internal development use, making them suitable for integration into a clinical decision support prototype.
