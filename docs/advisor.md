# Advisor Guide

This document provides a guide to the Advisor feature (tool A), including its integration with OpenAI's Code Interpreter for data analysis and visualization.

## Overview

The Advisor is an AI-powered chatbot that provides general medical information and allows users to ask questions based on attached patient data. It operates in two modes to optimize both speed and functionality.

### Key Features

- **Dual-Mode Operation**: Both modes support charts, tables, and HTML output. Think mode uses a reasoning model (Code Interpreter) for deeper analysis, while Regular mode relies on the language model.
- **AI-Powered Chat**: Utilizes OpenAI models (e.g., `gpt-4.1-mini`) for medical queries
- **Patient Context**: Can answer questions based on the data of a selected patient
- **Code Interpreter Integration**: Uses OpenAI's Code Interpreter in Think mode for automatic chart and table generation
- **Streaming Responses**: Text responses are streamed to the user for a real-time experience
- **Clinical Guidelines Integration**: References evidence-based guidelines from USPSTF, NICE, NCI PDQ, and RxNorm

## Operating Modes

### Regular Mode (Default)
- **Fast Response**: Uses Chat Completions API for quick text-based medical advice
- **Markdown & Recharts**: Generates tables and charts directly in markdown/HTML or via front-end chart components (no server-side Python execution)
- **Clinical Analysis**: Provides detailed clinical interpretation and visualizations based on model output

### Think Mode (Advanced Analysis)
- **Code Interpreter**: Uses OpenAI's Assistants API with Code Interpreter tool for Python-based analysis
- **Enhanced Visualizations**: Can run Python code to create complex or custom charts and data transformations
- **Deeper Reasoning**: Offers multi-step reasoning and data processing beyond language model capabilities

## Code Interpreter Integration (Think Mode)

The system uses OpenAI's Assistants API with the Code Interpreter tool for advanced medical data analysis and visualization in Think mode.

### How It Works

#### Regular Mode Flow
1. **Patient Context**: When a patient is selected, their clinical data is fetched
2. **Chat Completion**: Uses Chat Completions API for fast text-based responses  
3. **Markdown Analysis**: Creates structured data analysis using markdown tables and lists
4. **Visualization Guidance**: When users request charts, provides guidance to enable Think mode

#### Think Mode Flow
1. **Patient Context**: When a patient is selected, their clinical data is fetched
2. **Assistant Analysis**: A dedicated OpenAI Assistant with Code Interpreter analyzes the data
3. **Proactive Visualization**: The assistant proactively creates charts and tables for time-series data, comparisons, or clinical trends
4. **Simulated Streaming**: Text responses are streamed, and chart loading placeholders are displayed
5. **Result Display**: The final charts and tables are rendered in the chat interface

### API Endpoints

-   **`GET /api/advisor/image/[fileId]`**: Serves images generated by the Code Interpreter.

### Event Types

The Advisor handles several server-sent event types:
- `markdown_chunk`: Text content from the assistant.
- `code_interpreter_code`: Python code that was executed.
- `code_interpreter_output`: Text output from code execution.
- `code_interpreter_image`: The file ID for a generated chart.

### Environment Variables

To use the Code Interpreter integration, you need to set the following environment variables:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
MEDICAL_ADVISOR_ASSISTANT_ID=asst_your_advisor_assistant_id
CLINICAL_ENGINE_ASSISTANT_ID=asst_your_clinical_engine_assistant_id
```

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Use Regular Mode
- Quick medical consultations and advice
- General medical questions without complex data analysis
- Fast text-based clinical guidance
- Initial patient assessments

### When to Use Think Mode
- Complex data analysis requiring charts and visualizations
- Time-series analysis of lab results or vital signs
- Medication history tracking and trend analysis
- Comprehensive clinical pattern recognition
- When specifically requesting charts, graphs, or data visualizations

## Roadmap and Future Enhancements

- **Enhanced Visualizations**: Improve chart quality and styling for medical presentations
- **Interactive Charts**: Future versions may include support for interactive charts
- **Real-time Progress**: Show real-time progress of chart generation in Think mode
- **Hybrid Mode**: Automatically detect when visualizations would be beneficial and suggest Think mode

## Troubleshooting

- **Assistant Creation**: If assistant IDs are not provided in the environment variables, the system will create new ones and log their IDs to the console.
- **Image Loading Issues**: If charts do not display, check the browser console for errors and verify your OpenAI API key has the correct permissions.
