# Infinite Loop Fix - Final Solution
## Date: May 27, 2025

## Problem Summary
The "New Consultation" modal was triggering an infinite loop that created multiple duplicate encounters rapidly. This issue occurred 4 times despite previous fix attempts.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Double Navigation
- NewConsultationModal navigated to patient page after creating encounter
- Then called onConsultationCreated callback
- Which triggered onSelect in PatientsListView  
- Which called handlePatientSelect in ForesightApp
- Which attempted to navigate AGAIN to the same patient page
- This double navigation could cause state corruption and modal reopening

### 2. No Protection Against Double-Clicking
- Users could click "Start Consultation" multiple times before the first request completed
- Each click would create a new encounter

### 3. Stale Form State
- Modal state wasn't being reset when closed
- Could lead to unexpected behavior when reopened

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Eliminated Double Navigation
```typescript
// Close modal FIRST
onOpenChange(false);

// Navigate to patient page
router.push(`/patients/${patient.id}?encounterId=${encounter.id}`);

// Return early - don't call onConsultationCreated after navigation
return;
```

### 2. Added Loading State Protection
```typescript
const [isCreating, setIsCreating] = useState(false);

const handleCreate = async () => {
  // Prevent double-clicking
  if (isCreating) return;
  
  try {
    setIsCreating(true);
    // ... create encounter ...
  } finally {
    setIsCreating(false);
  }
};
```

### 3. Form State Reset on Close
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (!open) {
    // Reset ALL form state
    setTab('existing');
    setSearchTerm('');
    setSelectedPatient(null);
    // ... reset all other fields ...
  }
}, [open]);
```

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Click "New Consultation" button
- [ ] Select a patient and click "Start Consultation"
- [ ] Verify only ONE encounter is created
- [ ] Try double-clicking "Start Consultation" - should be prevented
- [ ] Close and reopen modal - form should be reset
- [ ] Test with both existing and new patient tabs

## Future Prevention
1. Always close modals BEFORE navigation
2. Use loading states to prevent double-submissions
3. Reset form state when modals close
4. Avoid callback chains that trigger navigation
5. Test for race conditions and double-clicks
