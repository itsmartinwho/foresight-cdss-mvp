# Draggable and Minimizable Modals - Implementation Status

## Status: âœ… COMPLETED

All major features have been successfully implemented and tested.

## Recent Fixes (June 2025)

### 1. Minimize Button Not Working
**Issue**: The minimize button was clickable but didn't do anything when clicked.

**Root Cause**: The `DraggableDialogContent` component was using a `isMounted` state that prevented proper initialization of the modal drag hook. The hook was being initialized with a null config because `isMounted` was false at initialization time.

**Fix Applied**: 
- Removed the conditional config logic in `DraggableDialogContent`
- Directly pass the config to `useModalDragAndMinimize` when draggable is true
- Removed unnecessary `onOpenAutoFocus` and `onCloseAutoFocus` callbacks

**Result**: Minimize button now works correctly - modals minimize to the bottom bar and can be restored.

### 2. Off-Center Modal Positioning
**Issue**: Modals appeared off-center when first opened.

**Root Cause**: 
- Hardcoded default positions that didn't account for different screen sizes
- Incorrect center calculation logic that didn't properly center modals

**Fix Applied**:
- Removed hardcoded `defaultPosition` from modal configurations
- Improved the `getCenterPosition` function to properly calculate center based on viewport dimensions
- Changed default modal size assumptions from 800x600 to 600x500 for better fit
- Cleared persisted modal positions to reset state

**Result**: Modals now open properly centered on the screen.

### 3. Overlay Persistence Issue
**Issue**: Modal overlay remained visible after minimizing modals, blocking UI interaction.

**Root Cause**: Dialog components were registering with the modal manager even when not mounted.

**Fix Applied**: Added proper mount/unmount tracking and conditional registration.

**Result**: Overlay correctly appears/disappears with modal state changes.

## Current Features Working

1. **Draggable Modals**: Click and drag the title bar to move modals
2. **Minimizable Modals**: Click minimize button to minimize to bottom bar
3. **Restore from Minimized**: Click minimized modal in bottom bar to restore
4. **Position Persistence**: Modal positions are saved and restored
5. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Ctrl+M to minimize active modal
6. **Z-Index Management**: Clicking a modal brings it to front
7. **Overlay Management**: Centralized overlay that shows/hides appropriately

## Known Limitations

1. **Modal Disappearing**: After dragging a modal multiple times, it may occasionally disappear (rare edge case)
2. **Position Persistence**: Persisted positions from different screen sizes may need manual adjustment
