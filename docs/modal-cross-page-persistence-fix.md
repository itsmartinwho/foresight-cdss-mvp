# Cross-Page Modal Persistence Fix

## Problem Summary

Minimized modals were not persisting across page navigation. When users minimized a modal on one page and navigated to another page, the minimized modal would disappear from the minimized modal bar and be lost.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was in the modal lifecycle management:

1. **Modal Registration Lifecycle**: When navigating between pages, modal components unmount and remount
2. **Unregistration on Unmount**: The original code completely unregistered modals when components unmounted
3. **Lost Minimized State**: This caused minimized modals to be completely removed from the global state
4. **Storage vs. State Mismatch**: While sessionStorage correctly persisted the minimized state, the in-memory state was reset

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Enhanced Modal Manager Actions

Added a new action `SET_MODAL_VISIBILITY` to allow modals to be marked as invisible without being fully unregistered:

```typescript
type ModalManagerAction = 
  // ... existing actions
  | { type: 'SET_MODAL_VISIBILITY'; payload: { id: string; isVisible: boolean } };
```

### 2. Smart Unmount Behavior

Modified `useModalDragAndMinimize` hook to handle component unmounting differently based on modal state:

```typescript
// When component unmounts, mark modal as not visible but don't unregister
// This allows minimized modals to persist across page navigation
const modalState = getModalState(config!.id);
if (modalState && modalState.isMinimized) {
  // If modal is minimized, just mark as not visible
  setModalVisibility(config!.id, false);
} else {
  // If modal is not minimized, fully unregister it
  unregisterModal(config!.id);
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Persistence Layer

Updated the persistence layer to store modal metadata (title, icon) required for minimized modal display:

```typescript
interface PersistedModalData {
  position: ModalPosition;
  zIndex: number;
  isMinimized: boolean;
  timestamp: number;
  title?: string;
  icon?: React.ComponentType<{ className?: string }> | string;
}
```

### 4. Cross-Page Restoration Logic

Enhanced modal registration to detect and handle cross-page restoration:

```typescript
// If the modal was restored while component wasn't mounted, 
// it will have isMinimized: false but isVisible: false
// In this case, we should show it restored, not minimized
const shouldShowRestored = !existingModal.isMinimized && !existingModal.isVisible;
```

## Key Benefits

### ✅ **Persistent Minimized Modals**
- Minimized modals now persist in the bottom taskbar across all pages
- Users can minimize a modal on one page and restore it on any other page

### ✅ **Cross-Page Modal Restoration**
- When a minimized modal is restored, it works correctly even if restored on a different page than where it was minimized
- Modal position and state are preserved

### ✅ **No Overlay Issues**
- The fix maintains the existing overlay management logic
- No risk of reintroducing the previous overlay blocking issues

### ✅ **Backward Compatibility**
- All existing modal functionality remains unchanged
- Non-minimized modals continue to work exactly as before

## Technical Implementation Details

### Files Modified

1. **`src/components/ui/modal-manager.tsx`**
   - Added `SET_MODAL_VISIBILITY` action
   - Enhanced restoration logic for cross-page scenarios
   - Added `setModalVisibility` method to context

2. **`src/hooks/useModalDragAndMinimize.tsx`**
   - Modified component unmount behavior
   - Added smart unregistration logic based on modal state

3. **`src/lib/modalPersistence.ts`**
   - Enhanced `PersistedModalData` interface to include title and icon
   - Updated `saveModalPosition` to accept and preserve modal metadata

4. **`src/types/modal.ts`**
   - Added `setModalVisibility` method to `ModalManagerContextType`

### Testing

Created comprehensive end-to-end tests (`tests/e2e/modal-cross-page-persistence.spec.ts`) to verify:
- Minimized modals persist across navigation
- Restored modals appear in correct positions
- Multiple modal scenarios work correctly

## Usage Examples

### Before the Fix
```
1. User opens modal on Dashboard
2. User minimizes modal → appears in taskbar
3. User navigates to Patients page → modal disappears from taskbar ❌
4. User loses access to the minimized modal ❌
```

### After the Fix
```
1. User opens modal on Dashboard
2. User minimizes modal → appears in taskbar
3. User navigates to Patients page → modal stays in taskbar ✅
4. User clicks minimized modal → modal restores and is visible ✅
5. User navigates back to Dashboard → modal remains open ✅
```

## Edge Cases Handled

1. **Component Unmounting**: Minimized modals survive component unmounting
2. **SessionStorage Expiry**: Modal state is cleaned up appropriately after 1 hour
3. **Multiple Navigation**: Works across multiple page transitions
4. **Position Persistence**: Modal positions are maintained across restoration
5. **Metadata Preservation**: Modal titles and icons persist for taskbar display

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements could include:
- Visual indicators when restoring modals that were minimized on other pages
- Modal workspace management (grouping related modals)
- Enhanced keyboard shortcuts for cross-page modal management

## Compatibility

- ✅ **Browser Support**: Works in all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- ✅ **Mobile Responsive**: Touch-friendly minimized modal restoration
- ✅ **Accessibility**: Screen reader support maintained
- ✅ **Performance**: No impact on page navigation performance
