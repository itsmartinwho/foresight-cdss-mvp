# Encounter Deletion Fixes

## Issues Fixed

This document outlines the fixes applied to resolve the encounter deletion problems reported by the user.

### Problem Statement

1. **Soft Delete Issue**: Clicking "delete permanently" in a patient's workspace did not actually delete encounters from the "All data" tab
2. **Hard Delete Issue**: When navigating back to the patients tab after deleting encounters, deleted ones were still appearing in "All consultations"
3. **Both soft delete and hard delete operations were not working properly**

### Root Causes Identified

1. **Async Operation Issues**: The deletion methods were not properly awaiting database operations
2. **ID Mismatch**: The system was confusing Supabase UUIDs with composite keys, causing database operations to fail
3. **Missing Error Handling**: No proper error handling or rollback mechanisms on database failures
4. **No Filtering**: The `getPatientEncounters` method was not filtering out deleted encounters by default
5. **Missing Timestamp**: Soft deletes weren't setting proper `deletedAt` timestamps

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Database Service Layer (`src/lib/supabaseDataService.ts`)

#### Updated `markEncounterAsDeleted` Method
- **Changed from synchronous to asynchronous**: Now properly awaits database operations
- **Fixed ID handling**: Correctly identifies whether the passed ID is a composite key or Supabase UUID
- **Added error handling**: Reverts in-memory changes if database operations fail
- **Added timestamp**: Sets `deletedAt` timestamp when soft deleting
- **Returns boolean**: Indicates success/failure of the operation

#### Updated `restoreEncounter` Method
- **Made asynchronous**: Properly awaits database operations  
- **Fixed ID handling**: Same ID resolution logic as soft delete
- **Added error handling**: Reverts changes on database failure
- **Clears timestamp**: Removes `deletedAt` when restoring

#### Updated `permanentlyDeleteEncounter` Method
- **Made asynchronous**: Properly awaits database operations
- **Fixed ID handling**: Uses correct Supabase UUID for database operations
- **Added rollback**: Restores in-memory data if database deletion fails
- **Proper cleanup**: Removes from both encounters cache and patient encounter lists

#### Updated `getPatientEncounters` Method
- **Added filtering**: Now filters out deleted encounters by default
- **Optional inclusion**: Added `includeDeleted` parameter for cases where deleted encounters are needed (like AllDataViewTab)

#### Updated `getPatientData` Method
- **Includes all encounters**: Now passes `includeDeleted: true` to provide comprehensive data for the AllDataViewTab

#### Updated Data Loading
- **Added `deletedAt` field**: Both single patient and bulk loading now properly handle the `deletedAt` timestamp

### 2. Patient Workspace View (`src/components/views/PatientWorkspaceViewModern.tsx`)

#### Updated `handleDeleteEncounter` Function
- **Made asynchronous**: Now properly awaits the deletion operation
- **Added success checking**: Verifies the operation succeeded before updating UI
- **Improved error handling**: Shows appropriate toast messages for success/failure
- **Better state management**: Only updates UI state if database operation succeeds

### 3. All Data View Tab (`src/components/patient-workspace-tabs/AllDataViewTab.tsx`)

#### Updated `handleRestore` Function
- **Made asynchronous**: Properly awaits restore operation
- **Added loading states**: Tracks which encounters are being restored
- **Better error handling**: Shows toast notifications for success/failure
- **UI feedback**: Disables buttons and shows loading text during operations

#### Updated `handlePermanentDelete` Function
- **Made asynchronous**: Properly awaits deletion operation
- **Added loading states**: Tracks which encounters are being deleted
- **Better error handling**: Shows appropriate error messages
- **UI improvements**: Loading states and disabled buttons during operations

#### Enhanced Button States
- **Loading indicators**: Buttons show "Restoring..." or "Deleting..." during operations
- **Disabled states**: Buttons are disabled during operations to prevent double-clicks
- **Visual feedback**: Clear indication of operation progress

## Data Flow

### Soft Delete Process
1. User clicks delete button in patient workspace
2. `handleDeleteEncounter` calls `markEncounterAsDeleted`
3. Database record updated with `is_deleted: true`
4. In-memory cache updated with `isDeleted: true` and `deletedAt` timestamp
5. UI state updated to remove from active encounters list
6. Encounter appears in "Deleted Items" section of AllDataViewTab

### Hard Delete Process
1. User clicks "Delete permanently" in AllDataViewTab
2. `handlePermanentDelete` calls `permanentlyDeleteEncounter`
3. Database record completely removed
4. In-memory cache entry deleted
5. UI state updated to remove from all encounter lists
6. Encounter no longer appears anywhere in the interface

### Restore Process
1. User clicks "Restore" in AllDataViewTab deleted items section
2. `handleRestore` calls `restoreEncounter`
3. Database record updated with `is_deleted: false`
4. In-memory cache updated to remove `isDeleted` and `deletedAt` flags
5. UI state updated to move back to active encounters
6. Encounter appears in dropdown and other encounter lists

## Error Handling

- **Database Failures**: All methods check for database errors and revert in-memory changes
- **ID Resolution**: Robust handling of both composite keys and Supabase UUIDs
- **User Feedback**: Toast notifications inform users of success/failure
- **Loading States**: UI clearly indicates when operations are in progress
- **Rollback Logic**: Failed operations are properly rolled back to maintain data consistency

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Soft Delete**: Delete an encounter, verify it disappears from dropdown but appears in "Deleted Items"
2. **Navigation Test**: Delete encounters, navigate away and back, verify they stay deleted
3. **Hard Delete**: Permanently delete from "Deleted Items", verify complete removal
4. **Restore**: Restore a soft-deleted encounter, verify it reappears in active lists
5. **Error Scenarios**: Test with network issues to verify proper error handling

## Breaking Changes

- **Async Methods**: Any code calling the deletion methods now needs to await them
- **Return Values**: Methods now return boolean success indicators instead of void
- **Filtering**: `getPatientEncounters` now filters deleted encounters by default

## Migration Notes

Existing code calling these methods should be updated to:
1. Add `await` keyword for async operations
2. Check return values for success/failure
3. Handle the new `includeDeleted` parameter where needed
