### Differential Diagnoses Scrollability Fix (December 2024)

**Problem**: The differential diagnoses list in the ConsultationPanel modal was not vertically scrollable, preventing users from seeing all 5 diagnosis cards. Only 2-3 cards were visible with no scrolling capability.

**Root Cause**: The issue was caused by improper container hierarchy and missing flexbox constraints:
- Parent container using `overflow-hidden` prevented scrolling
- No proper height constraints established for child scroll containers
- DifferentialDiagnosesList component lacked scrollable structure
- Wrapper div in ConsultationPanel blocked height propagation

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Restructured DifferentialDiagnosesList Component**:
   - Changed from simple div to flex column layout: `w-full h-full flex flex-col`
   - Fixed header: `flex-shrink-0` to prevent compression
   - Scrollable content: `flex-1 overflow-y-auto min-h-0` for proper flexbox scrolling
   - Inner content wrapper: `space-y-4 pr-2` with right padding for scrollbar space

2. **Updated ConsultationPanel Container**:
   - Removed unnecessary wrapper div around DifferentialDiagnosesList
   - Applied `h-full` directly to component for proper height constraint
   - Maintained existing overflow-hidden on parent containers

3. **Fixed Loading/Empty States**:
   - Updated to use `h-full flex items-center justify-center` layout
   - Ensures consistent behavior across all component states

**Key Implementation Details**:
- **Flexbox Pattern**: `flex-1 overflow-y-auto min-h-0` is crucial for scrollable flex children
- **Height Constraints**: Parent containers need `overflow-hidden` to establish height boundaries
- **Scroll Container**: Uses native browser scrolling with `pr-2` for scrollbar space
- **Fixed Elements**: Header uses `flex-shrink-0`, footer uses `flex-shrink-0` when present

**Components Modified**:
- `src/components/diagnosis/DifferentialDiagnosesList.tsx` - Complete layout restructure
- `src/components/modals/ConsultationPanel.tsx` - Removed wrapper div for differentials tab

**Testing Results**:
- All 5 differential diagnosis cards now accessible through vertical scrolling
- Header remains fixed during scroll operations
- Works in demo mode where editing is disabled
- Native browser scrolling behavior maintained

**Key Learning**: When implementing scrollable content in flexbox containers, the pattern `flex-1 overflow-y-auto min-h-0` is essential for the scroll container, with parent containers using `overflow-hidden` to establish proper height constraints.
