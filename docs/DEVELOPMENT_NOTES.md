### Differential Diagnoses Scrollability Fix (December 2024)

**Problem**: The differential diagnoses list in the ConsultationPanel modal was not vertically scrollable, preventing users from seeing all 5 diagnosis cards. Only 2-3 cards were visible with no scrolling capability.

**Root Cause**: The issue was caused by nested containers with conflicting overflow settings:
- Parent containers using conditional `overflow-visible` when on differentials tab
- The `overflow-visible` setting prevented proper height constraints from being established
- Child scroll containers couldn't determine their available height for scrolling

**Solution**:
1. **Simplified container overflow**: Removed conditional overflow settings (`overflow-visible`/`overflow-hidden`) from parent containers in `ConsultationPanel.tsx`
2. **Consistent height constraints**: Set `overflow-hidden` on all parent containers to establish proper flexbox height constraints
3. **Optimized scroll container**: Simplified `DifferentialDiagnosesList.tsx` scroll container to use standard flex patterns:
   - `flex-1` for available height
   - `overflow-y-auto` for vertical scrolling
   - `min-h-0` to allow flexbox shrinking

**Components Modified**:
- `src/components/modals/ConsultationPanel.tsx` - Lines 728, 742
- `src/components/diagnosis/DifferentialDiagnosesList.tsx` - Scroll container structure

**Key Learning**: When implementing scrollable content in flexbox containers, ensure parent containers have `overflow-hidden` to establish proper height constraints. Avoid `overflow-visible` as it prevents height constraint propagation.

**Testing**: Verified that all 5 differential diagnosis cards are now accessible through vertical scrolling within the modal.
