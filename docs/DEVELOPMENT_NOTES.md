### Differential Diagnoses Scrollability Fix (July 2024)

**Problem**: The differential diagnoses list in the `ConsultationPanel` modal was not vertically scrollable. The root cause was that the flexbox height constraint from the modal's top-level container was not being correctly propagated down to the list component, preventing `overflow-y-auto` from activating.

**Root Cause**: While `DifferentialDiagnosesList` was correctly structured internally to have a scrollable content area (`flex-1 overflow-y-auto min-h-0`), its immediate parent container in `ConsultationPanel.tsx` (`<div class="... p-4">`) was a block-level element, not a flex container. This broke the height propagation chain, so the `h-full` prop on `DifferentialDiagnosesList` had no effect.

**Solution Implemented**:
1.  **Enabled Flexbox Hierarchy in `ConsultationPanel.tsx`**:
    *   The parent `div` wrapping the tab content (the one with `p-4`) was converted into a flex container by adding `flex flex-col`. This ensures it passes flex context to its children.
    *   The `DifferentialDiagnosesList` component is now passed `className="flex-1 min-h-0"` instead of `h-full`. This makes it a proper flex child that grows and shrinks correctly within its parent.

2.  **Simplified `DifferentialDiagnosesList.tsx`**:
    *   The hardcoded `h-full` class was removed from the component's root `div`. Its size is now correctly and exclusively controlled by the props passed from its parent (`ConsultationPanel.tsx`), making it more reusable.

**Key Learning**: For a scrollable flex child (e.g., `flex-1 overflow-y-auto`) to work, **every parent in the hierarchy must correctly propagate height constraints**. If a `div` in the middle of a flexbox chain is not itself a flex container (`display: flex`), it will break the chain, and children with `flex-1` or `h-full` will not receive the necessary height to calculate overflow. The fix was to ensure the immediate parent was also a `flex-col` container.

**Components Modified**:
- `src/components/modals/ConsultationPanel.tsx`: Added `flex-col` to the tab content wrapper and changed the prop passed to the list component to `flex-1 min-h-0`.
- `src/components/diagnosis/DifferentialDiagnosesList.tsx`: Removed the redundant `h-full` class from the root element.

**Testing Results**:
- All 5 differential diagnosis cards are now accessible through vertical scrolling.
- The list's header remains fixed during scroll operations as intended.
- The solution works correctly in both normal and demo modes.
