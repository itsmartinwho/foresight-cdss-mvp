          content: `The USPSTF recommends early, universal screening for syphilis infection during pregnancy; if an individual is not screened early in pregnancy, the USPSTF recommends screening at the first available opportunity.

IMPLEMENTATION:
- Perform screening as early in pregnancy as possible, when a pregnant patient first presents to care
- If early screening was not done, screening should occur at the first opportunity, even if that is at presentation for delivery
- Screening should include both a treponemal and nontreponemal test

RATIONALE:
- Untreated syphilis infection during pregnancy can be passed to the fetus, causing congenital syphilis
- Congenital syphilis is associated with premature birth, low birth weight, stillbirth, neonatal death, and significant abnormalities in the infant
- In 2023, there were 3882 cases of congenital syphilis in the US, including 279 congenital syphilis-related stillbirths and neonatal/infant deaths

IMPLEMENTATION:
- Provide education and counseling about breastfeeding benefits
- Offer practical support during pregnancy and postpartum period
- Coordinate with lactation consultants and support groups
- Address common barriers to successful breastfeeding

RATIONALE:
- Breastfeeding provides important health benefits for both infants and mothers
- Primary care interventions can significantly increase breastfeeding initiation and duration
- Evidence shows behavioral counseling interventions are effective in promoting breastfeeding

RATIONALE:
- Food insecurity is associated with poor health outcomes
- Limited evidence on the effectiveness of screening in primary care settings
- More research needed on screening tools and interventions

CLINICAL CONSIDERATIONS:
- Clinicians may consider asking about food access as part of social determinants assessment
- Resources for food assistance should be available if screening is conducted
- Consider community partnerships for comprehensive support

- Flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years plus FIT every year
- CT colonography every 5 years
- Fecal immunochemical test (FIT) annually
- Guaiac-based fecal occult blood test annually
- Multitarget stool DNA test every 1-3 years

IMPLEMENTATION:
- Begin screening at age 45 for average-risk adults
- Continue screening through age 75
- For ages 76-85, individualize decision based on patient factors
- Ensure adequate follow-up for abnormal results

- Obtain multiple measurements on separate occasions
- Confirm diagnosis with ambulatory or home blood pressure monitoring
- Screen at least every 2 years if normal (<120/80 mmHg)

- Screen all adults including pregnant and postpartum women
- Consider screening more frequently for high-risk populations
