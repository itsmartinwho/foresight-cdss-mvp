## Recent Updates

### 2025-01-30: Guidelines Interface Improvements
- ✅ **Removed all mock guidelines** from search API and components
- ✅ **Enhanced empty state messaging** with helpful guidance when no guidelines are loaded
- ✅ **Added source URL functionality** in both cards and modal with "View Original Source" buttons
- ✅ **Improved debugging** with better logging when no guidelines are found
- ✅ **Enhanced user experience** for cases where database has no clinical guidelines loaded yet

**Issues Fixed:**
- Search no longer returns mock/placeholder guidelines
- Guidelines tab now shows informative message when no data is available
- Users can now access original source URLs when available
- Better distinction between "no results for search" vs "no guidelines in database"

## Next Steps

Moving forward, we should focus on:
1. **Data Ingestion** - Loading actual clinical guidelines from sources like USPSTF, NICE, NCI PDQ
2. **User Testing** - Gathering feedback on the guideline search and filtering experience
3. **Integration Testing** - Ensuring the Medical Advisor properly integrates guideline references
4. **Performance Optimization** - Optimizing search performance with large guideline datasets
