# Prior Authorization & Referral Forms - Implementation Tasks

## üéØ Status: COMPLETED
**Completion: 100%** ‚úÖ

### Issues Fixed (Latest Update)
1. ‚úÖ **Field Pre-population**: Forms now properly auto-populate with diagnosis, treatment, and ICD-10 codes from the selected encounter
2. ‚úÖ **PDF Download Fixed**: Resolved server-side `document is not defined` error and PDF downloads now work properly
3. ‚úÖ **Dropdown Layout**: Resource type dropdowns now display text in a single line with better formatting
4. ‚úÖ **Resource Type Selection**: Added visual feedback (toast notifications) when resource types are selected
5. ‚úÖ **API Import Issues**: Fixed SupabaseDataService import errors in differential diagnoses API

### Recent Changes (January 30, 2025)
- **Fixed PDF Generation**: Resolved server-side error where `document.createElement` was being called on the server
- **Fixed Data Service Import**: Corrected import to use singleton instance instead of class in differential diagnoses API
- **Enhanced auto-population logic**: Diagnosis descriptions, ICD-10 codes, and treatment information now properly extracted
- **Improved PDF download workflow**: API returns base64 data that client properly decodes and downloads
- **Better dropdown UX**: Resource type descriptions display inline instead of stacked vertically
- **Toast notifications**: User gets visual feedback when resource types are changed

### Technical Implementation
- Prior authorization and referral forms are now fully functional with proper field pre-population
- PDF generation works correctly with base64 encoding/decoding
- Forms properly handle resource type changes with user feedback
- All server-side errors resolved
