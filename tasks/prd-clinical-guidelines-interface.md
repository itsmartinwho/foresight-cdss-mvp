# Product Requirements Document: Clinical Guidelines Interface

## Introduction/Overview

This feature introduces a comprehensive Clinical Guidelines interface that makes the extensive clinical knowledge base easily accessible and navigable for healthcare professionals. The solution includes a dedicated Guidelines tab in the sidebar navigation, enhanced search functionality, and improved medical advisor integration with specialty filtering.

**Problem Statement:** While the backend clinical guidelines system is robust with 15+ guidelines from authoritative sources (USPSTF, NICE, NCI PDQ), there's currently no user-friendly interface for clinicians to discover, browse, and apply this knowledge in their daily workflow.

**Goal:** Create an intuitive, visually appealing interface that allows healthcare professionals to efficiently access, filter, and apply clinical guidelines while maintaining integration with existing patient care workflows.

## Goals

1. **Discoverability:** Enable easy browsing and discovery of clinical guidelines organized by medical specialty
2. **Accessibility:** Provide multiple pathways to access guidelines (dedicated tab, search, medical advisor integration)
3. **Usability:** Create an intuitive interface that reduces cognitive load for busy healthcare professionals
4. **Integration:** Seamlessly connect guidelines with existing patient care and advisor workflows
5. **Personalization:** Allow customization through favorites/bookmarks and specialty filtering

## User Stories

1. **As a primary care physician,** I want to browse diabetes management guidelines so that I can quickly reference current best practices during patient consultations.

2. **As a cardiologist,** I want to filter guidelines by my specialty so that I only see relevant cardiovascular guidance without being overwhelmed by oncology protocols.

3. **As an emergency medicine doctor,** I want to search for "chest pain" across all clinical guidelines so that I can quickly access relevant protocols from multiple sources.

4. **As a family medicine resident,** I want to bookmark frequently used guidelines so that I can quickly access them during busy clinic days.

5. **As a nurse practitioner,** I want the medical advisor to show which specific guidelines it's referencing so that I can verify recommendations with authoritative sources.

6. **As a healthcare administrator,** I want to see visual indicators of guideline recency so that I know our team is using up-to-date protocols.
