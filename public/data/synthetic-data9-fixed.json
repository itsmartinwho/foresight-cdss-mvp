How have they been?\nSandra: They're still quite itchy, Doctor, especially after I shower. And my sugars have been a bit all over the place, I'm afraid.\nClinician: I see from your chart that your last A1c was 7.8%, and we discussed the importance of tighter control. The skin condition, diabetic dermopathy, is often linked to blood sugar levels. Are you using the moisturizer regularly?\nSandra: I try, but sometimes I forget.\nClinician: And the Metformin, are you taking that as prescribed, 850mg twice a day?\nSandra: Yes, most of the time.\nClinician: Okay. Consistent medication and moisturizing are key. Given your A1c and ongoing skin symptoms, I'm going to increase your Metformin to 1000mg twice a day. For the itch, I'll also prescribe a mild steroid cream, hydrocortisone 1%, for you to use sparingly on the itchy areas for a week or two. We need to see if this brings some relief and improves the skin appearance.\nSandra: An increase in Metformin and a steroid cream? Will that help with the look of it too?\nClinician: Better blood sugar control can prevent new spots, and the steroid cream can help with the inflammation and itching of the current ones. It might take time for the appearance to improve though. Let's also get you to see our diabetes educator again to go over diet and monitoring. How does that sound?",

I've been getting them more often lately, maybe two or three times a week for the last month. They're usually on one side of my head, a throbbing pain.\nClinician: Any nausea, vomiting, or sensitivity to light or sound with these headaches?\nHelen: Sometimes light bothers me, and I feel a bit nauseous, but I haven't vomited.\nClinician: Any visual changes before the headache starts, like flashing lights?\nHelen: No, nothing like that.\nClinician: How long do they typically last? And what do you do for them?\nHelen: They can last for several hours, sometimes most ofthe day. I usually take some over-the-counter pain reliever and try to rest in a dark room.\nClinician: Your neurological exam today is normal. Given the unilateral, throbbing nature and photophobia, this sounds like migraine headaches. The original reason for visit was 'Disorders of meninges', which is less likely given your symptoms and normal exam today. We can discuss some options for acute treatment when a migraine starts, and if they continue to be this frequent, we can also talk about preventive medications.\nHelen: Migraines? I thought they were always super severe.\nClinician: They can vary a lot. Let's start by prescribing a triptan medication for you to take as soon as a headache starts. Keep a diary of your headaches too, noting any potential triggers. We'll see how you do with that first.\nHelen: Okay, I'm willing to try.",

I've been trying to play tennis more regularly.\nClinician: Let's take a look. (Performs physical exam, including resisted wrist extension). Okay, there's definite tenderness over the lateral epicondyle, and it hurts when you extend your wrist against my hand. This is classic for lateral epicondylitis, or 'tennis elbow'.

How have you been coping?\nBenjamin: It's still been a stressful time, Doctor, but my partner and the baby are doing okay now, which is a relief. I'm still checking my blood pressure at home, and it's a bit better, but not always where you said it should be.\nClinician: And are you still taking the Labetalol 200mg twice a day we prescribed?\nBenjamin: Yes, religiously.\nClinician: Good. Your reading in clinic today is 148/90. That's still a bit high. Your previous notes indicated 'Diseases of the circulatory system complicating the puerperium', which we're interpreting as hypertension exacerbated by the stress of your partner's situation. Given that your pressure is still elevated despite the Labetalol, I think we need to add a second agent. A low-dose thiazide diuretic, like hydrochlorothiazide, can be very effective in combination.\nBenjamin: Another pill? Will it make me go to the bathroom a lot?\nClinician: Initially, you might notice urinating a bit more, but that usually settles. It's a common and effective medication for blood pressure.

And the previous records also mention 'rheumatoid lung disease'. How have you been feeling?\nBenjamin: The shoulder is still the worst part, Doctor. Very stiff in the mornings, and it aches a lot. The wrist is a bit better with the Naproxen you gave me last time. I'm still pretty tired all the time.\nClinician: I have your blood test results here. The inflammatory markers, ESR and CRP, are still quite high, and your rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP antibodies are strongly positive. This confirms the diagnosis of active, seropositive rheumatoid arthritis affecting multiple joints. Regarding the 'rheumatoid lung disease' noted before, are you having any cough or shortness of breath?\nBenjamin: Not really, maybe a little short of breath if I exert myself a lot, but no persistent cough.\nClinician: Okay. Given the active inflammation and involvement of multiple joints, we need to be more aggressive with treatment to prevent joint damage and manage the systemic effects like fatigue. Continuing Naproxen for symptom relief is fine, but we really need to start a DMARD. I recommend we start Methotrexate. We'll begin with a low weekly dose and monitor your blood counts and liver function closely. You'll also take folic acid to minimize side effects. I will also refer you to a Rheumatologist for co-management and to further evaluate the lung aspect.\nBenjamin: Methotrexate...

Are you consistent with those?\nBenjamin: I try to be, but sometimes I miss doses.\nClinician: We really need to focus on adherence. Dr. Eye also recommended anti-VEGF injections for the macular edema. That's a very effective treatment. To help get your sugars down, I'm going to add a third oral agent, Sitagliptin.

Last time we confirmed active rheumatoid arthritis with positive blood markers and significant involvement of your right shoulder and left wrist, plus that history of 'rheumatoid lung disease'. We started you on Methotrexate 12.5mg weekly and Folic Acid. How have you been tolerating the Methotrexate?\nBenjamin: It's been okay, Doctor. Maybe a little nausea the day after I take it, but it passes. My shoulder still hurts quite a bit, and I'm still very tired.\nClinician: And the Naproxen for pain?\nBenjamin: It helps a bit, but doesn't take it all away.\nClinician: Methotrexate can take 6-8 weeks, sometimes longer, to show its full effect, so we're still early in the process. Your labs from this week show your liver function and blood counts are stable, which is good. The inflammatory markers are still high, though perhaps a tiny bit lower than before. Given your ongoing symptoms, especially the shoulder pain and fatigue, and the severity of your inflammation, I think we should consider adding a short course of oral Prednisone to help get things under control more quickly while the Methotrexate kicks in. This can provide more rapid relief.\nBenjamin: Prednisone? I've heard that has a lot of side effects.\nClinician: We use it for a short period at a moderate dose to manage acute flares, and then taper it off. Long-term use has more side effects, which is why we aim to get you well-controlled on a DMARD like Methotrexate. I've also received the report from the Rheumatologist you saw. They concur with the RA diagnosis and will be co-managing with us.

The previous note said 'Disorders of optic chiasm in (due to) neoplasm'.\nAnna: Yes, Doctor. I've been very worried since they told me there was something there.\nClinician: I understand completely. I have the detailed report from the MRI and the ophthalmologist's consultation. The MRI shows a mass that appears to be compressing the optic chiasm. The ophthalmologist noted some bitemporal hemianopsia, which means you're losing some of your peripheral vision on both sides. This is typical for a mass pressing on the chiasm. The most likely diagnosis, given the location and appearance, is a pituitary adenoma, specifically one large enough to cause this pressure, called a macroadenoma. While most are benign, their location can cause problems.\nAnna: A tumor pressing on my eye nerves? What do we do?\nClinician: We need to refer you urgently to a neurosurgeon and an endocrinologist. The neurosurgeon will evaluate if surgery is needed to decompress the optic chiasm and remove or reduce the tumor. The endocrinologist will do a full hormone panel because pituitary tumors can sometimes produce excess hormones or impair normal pituitary function. Surgery is often very effective in these cases for restoring vision if done timely.\nAnna: Surgery... Are there other options?\nClinician: For tumors causing vision loss by pressure, surgery is usually the primary treatment to relieve that pressure quickly. Some specific types of pituitary tumors can respond to medication, which the endocrinologist will assess. The neurosurgeon will discuss all risks and benefits with you. Our priority now is to get you seen by the specialists promptly.",

How has your left ankle and foot been since we last discussed the rheumatoid vasculitis affecting that area?\nScott: It's been a bit better with the medication you gave me, Doctor, but it still flares up, especially if I'm on my feet a lot. The swelling comes and goes, and sometimes it gets quite red and painful.\nClinician: The medication was a course of steroids, correct? And are you on any long-term medication for rheumatoid arthritis?\nScott: Yes, I finished the steroids. I'm not on anything long-term for arthritis right now.\nClinician: (Examines ankle/foot) There's still some mild swelling and tenderness in your left ankle and a few joints in the foot. Rheumatoid vasculitis means the inflammation from your rheumatoid arthritis is affecting the blood vessels, which can cause these kinds of persistent or recurrent problems. Given this, and the fact that it's affecting your mobility, we should really consider starting a Disease-Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drug, or DMARD, like Methotrexate. This is a long-term medication to control the underlying rheumatoid inflammation, not just treat the flares. It can help prevent joint damage and reduce vasculitis episodes.\nScott: Methotrexate? Is that a strong drug?\nClinician: It is effective, and like all medications, it has potential side effects that we monitor for with regular blood tests. It's a standard treatment for active rheumatoid arthritis, especially when there are complications like vasculitis. I'll also refer you to a Rheumatologist to co-manage your condition.\nScott: Okay, if it will help with this pain and swelling, I'm willing to consider it.",

The CT scan shows a 2.5cm well-circumscribed, highly vascular mass at the carotid bifurcation on the right, consistent with a carotid body tumor, also known as a paraganglioma. While most of these are benign, they can grow and press on nearby structures, and a small percentage can be malignant or produce hormones.\nScott: So it's a tumor? What do we do?\nClinician: The next step is a referral to a vascular surgeon and possibly an endocrinologist. The vascular surgeon will discuss the options, which often include surgical removal, especially for a tumor of this size that could potentially cause problems later. They may also want to do further imaging or tests to check if it's producing any hormones before considering surgery.\nScott: Surgery sounds risky there, near the main artery.\nClinician: It is a specialized surgery, and the vascular surgeon will explain all the risks and benefits.

I use my inhalers every day, and my rescue inhaler maybe a couple of times a week if I overdo it.\nClinician: Any recent cough, phlegm, or fevers?\nHelen: No, nothing unusual.\nClinician: (Listens to lungs) Your lungs sound pretty good today, just the usual quiet breath sounds of COPD, but no active wheezing or crackles. Your oxygen saturation is 92%. It seems your COPD is stable. Are you up to date with your flu and pneumonia vaccinations?\nHelen: Yes, I got my flu shot. I think I had a pneumonia shot a few years ago.\nClinician: We can check on that. It's important to keep those up to date. For today, we'll continue your current inhaler regimen.

The old notes mention `Rheumatic disorders of both mitral and tricuspid valves`.\nBetty: It's been a while, Doctor. I get short of breath more easily these days, especially if I try to do too much. And sometimes my ankles swell up.\nClinician: Are you on any medications for your heart or for fluid retention?\nBetty: I take a water pill, furosemide, when the swelling gets bad. I used to be on something else for my heart, but that was years ago.\nClinician: (Listens to heart and lungs) You have a noticeable murmur which is consistent with mitral valve regurgitation, and possibly some tricuspid regurgitation as well. Your lungs have a few crackles at the bases, which can suggest some fluid buildup. Given your symptoms of worsening shortness of breath and edema, and your history of rheumatic valve disease, we need to get an echocardiogram to assess your current valve function and heart muscle function. This will help us decide if your medications need adjustment or if further interventions are needed.\nBetty: An echocardiogram? Is that the ultrasound of the heart?\nClinician: Yes, exactly. It gives us a very good look at your valves and how well your heart is pumping. We'll also do some blood tests today to check your kidney function and electrolytes, especially with the diuretic use.\nBetty: Okay, Doctor. I have been feeling more tired lately.",

I actually made this appointment because I've been having a lot of allergy symptoms – itchy eyes, runny nose, sneezing, especially when I'm outdoors.\nClinician: I see. My apologies, sometimes old information can be prominent in the chart. Let's focus on your allergy symptoms then.

This is very consistent with seasonal allergic rhinitis. We can try a prescription nasal steroid spray, which is often more effective than oral antihistamines alone for nasal congestion and inflammation. You can continue the oral antihistamine as well if needed.\nBetty: A nasal spray?

Sometimes these bursitis flare-ups can be related to underlying arthritis or just overuse. Since the injection helped before, that's a good sign it's inflammatory bursitis.

I get panic attacks sometimes, and I'm just on edge a lot.\nClinician: I'm really glad to hear you've stopped using cocaine – that's a huge and important step.

And sometimes my jaw just feels tired and achy, particularly in the morning or if I've been clenching my teeth.\nClinician: Any locking of your jaw, or difficulty opening wide?\nSusan: Sometimes it feels a bit stiff to open in the morning, but no true locking. It just feels... off.\nClinician: (Examines TMJs and masticatory muscles) There's some clicking on opening and closing on the right side, and some tenderness in your masseter muscles. This is consistent with TMJ dysfunction, likely related to myofascial pain from muscle overuse, perhaps from clenching or grinding, and some internal derangement of the joint disc on the right.\nSusan: What can I do about it? It's really annoying.\nClinician: We can try several things. First, a soft diet for a while, avoiding very chewy or hard foods. Moist heat applied to the jaw muscles can help. I'll also show you some gentle jaw stretching and relaxation exercises. If you're clenching or grinding, especially at night, a custom-made occlusal splint or night guard from your dentist can be very beneficial. Over-the-counter anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen can help with the pain and inflammation during flare-ups.\nSusan: A night guard? I think I do clench my teeth at night.\nClinician: That would be a good avenue to explore with your dentist then. Let's start with these conservative measures and see how you do.",

Can you tell me what's been happening with your dialysis schedule?\nDennis: Doctor, it's just been really hard lately. I've missed a few sessions. I feel so tired all the time, and sometimes I just don't have the energy to go.\nClinician: I understand dialysis can be very demanding, Dennis. But missing sessions can be very dangerous for your health. When you miss dialysis, toxins and fluid build up in your body. Are you noticing any symptoms like more swelling, shortness of breath, or confusion?\nDennis: I have been more swollen in my legs, and I get out of breath easier.\nClinician: (Examines patient) Yes, you have significant pitting edema in your legs today, and your blood pressure is quite high at 170/100. Your lungs have some crackles too. These are signs that you're overloaded with fluid and toxins. We need to get you to your dialysis unit today, urgently if possible. We also need to understand what's making it hard for you to attend your sessions. Is it transportation, scheduling, how you feel during or after dialysis?\nDennis: It's a bit of everything. And sometimes I just feel hopeless about it all.\nClinician: It sounds like you might be struggling with some depression as well, which is very common for patients on dialysis. We need to address that. Our social worker can help with transportation or scheduling issues, and we can talk about treatment for depression. But the immediate priority is to get you dialyzed to remove the excess fluid and toxins. Let me call your dialysis unit now.",
