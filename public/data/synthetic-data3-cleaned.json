        "transcript": "Clinician: Kevin, thank you for coming in. Your wife expressed some concerns about your use of pain medication. Can you tell me a bit about that?\nPatient: (Hesitantly) Well, doctor, I have this chronic back pain from an old injury. The oxycodone is the only thing that really helps me function. Lately, the pain's been worse, so I've had to take it a bit more often than prescribed.\nClinician: I understand chronic pain is very difficult to manage. When you say 'more often', what does that look like? Are you running out of your prescription early?\nPatient: Yes, sometimes. And when I don't have it, I start feeling really awful â€“ shaky, sweaty, just sick all over.\nClinician: Those sound like withdrawal symptoms, Kevin. It's a sign that your body has become dependent on the opioid. Using more than prescribed or getting it from other sources significantly increases risks. We need to address both your pain and this dependence. There are treatments that can help, like buprenorphine, that can manage withdrawal and cravings while we work on better long-term pain strategies.",
        "soap_note": "S: 25-year-old male with a history of chronic low back pain, status post remote lumbar surgery. Presents at urging of wife due to concerns regarding escalating use of prescribed Oxycodone 10mg (prescribed 1 q6h PRN, admits to taking 1-2 q4h and occasionally sourcing extra pills). Reports tolerance (needing more for same effect) and withdrawal symptoms (anxiety, diaphoresis, myalgias) when medication wears off or is unavailable. Denies IV drug use or other illicit substances. Expresses desire to manage pain better without relying so heavily on opioids.\nO: BP 132/84, HR 90, RR 18. Appears anxious, mild hand tremor. No acute distress. Examination of back reveals well-healed surgical scar, mild paraspinal tenderness. No signs of acute intoxication. CINA scale score moderate during discussion of withdrawal.\nA: Opioid Use Disorder, moderate, with physiological dependence (tolerance and withdrawal). Chronic low back pain, likely neuropathic and nociceptive components. Currently experiencing opioid related disorders related to misuse/dependence.\nP: 1. Discuss diagnosis of Opioid Use Disorder and risks of current use pattern. 2. Offer Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT) with Buprenorphine/Naloxone; provide education and discuss benefits/risks. 3. If MAT accepted, arrange for induction and referral to addiction specialist/MAT program. 4. Develop a plan for multimodal pain management: refer to pain clinic, physical therapy, consider non-opioid analgesics (e.g., gabapentin, duloxetine). 5. Urine drug screen. 6. Prescribe Naloxone rescue kit and provide education to patient and wife.",
