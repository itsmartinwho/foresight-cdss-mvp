        "transcript": "Doctor: Good morning, Sandra. You're here today because of some ongoing skin issues and our previous discussion about your blood sugars being high after you were on that course of prednisone for your asthma flare-up. How are things?\nSandra: Morning, Doctor. Well, the asthma is much better, thanks to the prednisone. But my skin has been so dry and itchy, especially on my shins, and I've noticed a few rashes that come and go. And yes, my sugars have been higher than usual.\nDoctor: I see. High blood sugar, which can be induced by corticosteroids like prednisone, can sometimes affect the skin, causing dryness, itching, or making you more prone to certain rashes. Let's take a look at your skin. (Examines skin) Yes, I see some xerosis, which is dry skin, and a bit of a fungal rash in one of the skin folds. This can happen when blood sugars are elevated. We'll need to recheck your A1c today. How long have you been off the prednisone now?\nSandra: About two weeks.\nDoctor: Okay. Sometimes the blood sugar can take a little while to come back to normal. We'll treat the skin rash topically, and focus on getting your blood sugars back into a good range. It's important to monitor your skin for any new sores or infections, especially on your feet, while your sugars are still settling down, Sandra.\nSandra: Okay, Doctor. What can I use for the rash?\nDoctor: I'll prescribe a topical antifungal cream for that specific rash. And a good, thick moisturizer for the dry skin.",

Urination is fine, no discharge either.\nDoctor: Okay. I'll need to examine you, Joshua. There are a few things that can cause testicular pain and swelling, like an infection such as epididymitis, a torsion which is a twisting and is a surgical emergency, or sometimes a benign cyst or, much less commonly in your age group but something we always consider, a tumor.

I don't feel any distinct new lumps that are immediately alarming, but given the swelling and pain, I'd like to get an ultrasound of your scrotum to get a better look at the structures inside and confirm epididymitis.

Well, Katherine, since you're doing so well on the current dose, I'd recommend we continue it for another few months.

Both of these are quite high and indicate that you have Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.\nKatherine: Diabetes? I... I had no idea. I've been feeling a bit more tired lately and maybe thirstier than usual, but I just thought it was stress.\nDoctor: Those can certainly be symptoms. This is a new diagnosis for you, and I understand it can be a lot to take in. The good news is that Type 2 Diabetes is a manageable condition. Our first steps will be to focus on lifestyle changes â€“ diet and exercise â€“ and we'll also start you on a medication called Metformin to help lower your blood sugar. I'm going to refer you to our diabetes educator and a nutritionist who can give you detailed guidance.\nKatherine: Medication right away?\nDoctor: Yes, Katherine.

The cough has been there for a few weeks, but this morning, there was definitely blood in what I coughed up. Just a streak, but it scared me.\nDoctor: I can understand why. You had treatment for lung cancer in your right middle lobe a few years ago, is that correct?\nBetty: Yes, I had surgery and then some radiation.\nDoctor: Okay, Betty. Coughing up blood, especially with your history, is a red flag. We need to rule out a recurrence of the cancer, or perhaps a new primary lung cancer, or even an infection. I'm going to send you for an urgent CT scan of your chest today, and we'll get some sputum samples to check for infection and cancer cells. We also need to repeat any tumor markers that were relevant for you before.\nBetty: More cancer? I was hoping that was all behind me.\nDoctor: We need to find out what's causing this, Betty.

The gritty feeling isn't as constant, and the redness has gone down some. But my vision is still quite blurry, especially when I first wake up or if I'm in bright light.\nDoctor: Okay. (Examines eyes with slit lamp) Well, the good news is the surface inflammation is definitely less, and those small epithelial defects we saw are healing nicely. However, I'm still seeing those new blood vessels, the neovascularization, creeping onto your corneas. This is a response to the injury, but we need to ensure it doesn't progress and cloud your vision permanently.\nBetty: So the vessels are still there?\nDoctor: Yes, they are. It often takes time for them to regress, and sometimes they don't completely go away. The steroid drops are crucial for this. How are you managing with putting them in four times a day?\nBetty: It's a bit of a hassle, but I'm doing it. My daughter helps sometimes.\nDoctor: Good. We need to continue the Prednisolone drops for now, and also keep up with the frequent lubricating drops. The ophthalmologist you saw last week, did they suggest any other interventions at this point?\nBetty: They want to see me back in two weeks to monitor. They mentioned something about a special contact lens if it doesn't improve, or even a small surgery with amniotic membrane if these vessels get worse.\nDoctor: That sounds like a good plan. We'll work closely with them. For today, let's continue the current treatment and I'll see you back here as scheduled by the ophthalmologist, or sooner if anything changes for the worse, Betty.",
