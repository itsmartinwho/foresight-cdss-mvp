Can you tell me more about when this started?\nPatient: About a week ago, my stomach started getting bigger, and it's been really tender. Then my skin and eyes started turning yellow a few days ago. I also gained a lot of weight quickly.\nClinician: Any history of liver problems? Heavy alcohol use? Any recent new medications or herbal supplements?\nPatient: No, not really to any of that. I drink socially, maybe a beer or two on weekends. No new medications.\nClinician: We've run a number of tests. Your liver enzymes are very high, and the ultrasound showed an enlarged liver and fluid in your abdomen, which we call ascites. Given the rapid onset and these findings, we're concerned about hepatic veno-occlusive disease, also known as sinusoidal obstruction syndrome. This can sometimes be caused by certain toxins or medications, or sometimes the cause isn't clear.",

Denies significant alcohol history, IV drug use, or recent new medications/supplements. No prior liver disease.\nO: Temp 37.4Â°C, BP 110/70, HR 98. Visible jaundice of skin and sclera. Abdomen is distended, tender in RUQ, shifting dullness present. Moderate pitting edema in lower extremities. Labs: Total Bilirubin 8.5 mg/dL, AST 450 U/L, ALT 520 U/L, Alk Phos 300 U/L, INR 1.8. Ultrasound shows hepatomegaly, ascites, and altered hepatic vein flow.\nA: Suspected Hepatic Veno-occlusive Disease (Sinusoidal Obstruction Syndrome). Requires further investigation to identify underlying cause if possible, and supportive management.\nP: 1. Hepatology consult. 2. Viral hepatitis panel, autoimmune markers, ceruloplasmin, alpha-1 antitrypsin. 3. Paracentesis for SAAG and cell count if ascites significant. 4. Low sodium diet, diuretics (Spironolactone, Furosemide) for ascites management. 5. Monitor LFTs, INR, renal function daily. 6. Avoid hepatotoxic medications. 7. Consider liver biopsy if diagnosis remains unclear and patient is stable enough.",
