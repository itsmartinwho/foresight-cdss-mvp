That sounds serious, Doctor.\nDoctor: It can be, which is why we monitor it closely. Yours is currently small, but given your history of atherosclerosis in other vessels, it's important we manage your risk factors aggressively. We'll need regular imaging to track its size.\nAmanda: What can I do?\nDoctor: We'll focus on keeping your blood pressure well-controlled, managing your cholesterol with medication, and it's absolutely critical to stop smoking if you do. We'll also discuss if any specific medication for the aneurysm itself is needed right now, but good risk factor control is the mainstay.",

CT A/P report: Infrarenal AAA measuring 3.5 cm in maximal diameter. Moderate atherosclerotic changes in aorta and iliac arteries.\nA: Asymptomatic infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (I71.4), likely atherosclerotic. Atherosclerosis of aorta (I70.0). Uncontrolled Hypertension (I10).\nP: 1. Counsel patient on diagnosis, risks (rupture, growth), and need for surveillance. 2. Initiate Aspirin 81mg daily. 3. Start Atorvastatin 40mg daily for aggressive lipid lowering. 4. Intensify antihypertensive regimen: Increase Lisinopril to 20mg daily, add Amlodipine 5mg daily, target BP <130/80 mmHg. 5.
