That sounds serious. What symptoms have you been having?\nDennis: Doctor, it's been a rough week. Both my ears have been aching, especially behind them, and I've had a fever. There's also been some thick discharge from both ears.\nClinician: Any hearing loss or dizziness?\nDennis: My hearing feels muffled, and I've felt a bit off balance.\nClinician: (Performs otoscopy and mastoid examination) Yes, Dennis, both your eardrums are inflamed, and there's significant tenderness and some redness over the mastoid bones behind both ears. This is consistent with bilateral acute mastoiditis, likely a complication from an ear infection. We need to treat this aggressively with antibiotics, and I'm going to get a CT scan of your mastoids to see the extent of the infection and rule out any complications like an abscess.\nDennis: CT scan? And antibiotics? Is it that bad?\nClinician: Mastoiditis can be serious if not treated properly, as the infection is in the bone behind the ear. We'll start with strong oral antibiotics, but depending on the CT scan and how you respond, you might need IV antibiotics or even surgical drainage if there's a collection of pus. For now, pain relief and starting the antibiotics promptly is key.\nDennis: Okay, Doctor. I just want this pain to go away.",

The previous note mentioned a concern for 'Chronic lymphocytic leukemia of B-cell type'. How have you been feeling?\nDennis: I've been more tired than usual, Doctor, and I've noticed some swollen glands in my neck and under my arms. I also seem to be catching colds more easily than I used to.\nClinician: Any night sweats or unintentional weight loss?\nDennis: Maybe a little weight loss, a few pounds. No major night sweats, but I do feel generally run down.\nClinician: (Performs physical exam) You do have some enlarged lymph nodes in your neck and axillae, and your spleen feels a bit prominent today. These findings, along with your blood tests showing a high number of mature-looking lymphocytes, are indeed suspicious for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL). This is typically a slow-growing type of leukemia more common in older adults.\nDennis: Leukemia... that's a scary word.\nClinician: I understand. It's important to know that many people with CLL live for many years, and often don't need treatment right away if the disease is in an early stage and not causing significant problems. The next step is to confirm the diagnosis with a test called flow cytometry on your blood, which looks at specific markers on the lymphocytes. We'll also do some other blood tests to help stage the condition. I'm going to refer you to a hematologist-oncologist, a specialist in blood cancers, who will oversee your evaluation and management.\nDennis: So, more tests and a specialist?\nClinician: Yes, that's the standard approach to confirm the diagnosis and determine the best course of action, which might initially be observation, or 'watchful waiting', if your CLL is early stage.",

The previous notes mentioned 'Immunoproliferative small intestinal disease'.\nJohn: Yes, Doctor. I've had chronic diarrhea, abdominal pain, and I've lost quite a bit of weight over the past year. I just feel weak and unwell most of the time.\nClinician: Immunoproliferative small intestinal disease, or IPSID, is a rare condition that's considered a type of lymphoma affecting the small intestine, often linked to chronic immune stimulation. It's more common in certain geographic regions. We've done an endoscopy with biopsies, and the pathology confirms the diagnosis. Your blood tests also show some anemia and low albumin, which is common with this condition due to malabsorption.\nJohn: So it is a type of lymphoma? What's the treatment?\nClinician: Yes, it is. Treatment typically involves antibiotics initially, as it's often associated with certain bacterial infections that might trigger it. If there's not a good response, or if the disease is more advanced, then chemotherapy is usually required, similar to other types of lymphoma. We need to stage the disease fully with CT scans of your chest, abdomen, and pelvis to see if it has spread anywhere else.\nJohn: Antibiotics and possibly chemotherapy... This is a lot to take in.\nClinician: I understand. We'll refer you to a hematologist-oncologist who specializes in lymphomas. They will manage your treatment plan.

That's quite a broad term. Can you remind me of the specifics and how your treatment has been going?\nJohn: Yes, Doctor. It was a sarcoma in my thigh. I had surgery to remove it about six months ago, followed by radiation therapy which finished two months ago.\nClinician: And how are you feeling now? Any pain, swelling, or other issues with your thigh? Or any new symptoms elsewhere?\nJohn: The thigh is still a bit sore and stiff from the surgery and radiation, but it's slowly getting better. I'm doing my physiotherapy exercises. No new lumps or pains anywhere else that I've noticed. Just general fatigue sometimes.\nClinician: That's good that the local symptoms are improving and no new concerns. Today is a routine surveillance visit. We'll do a full physical exam, paying close attention to the surgical site and regional lymph nodes. We also need to schedule your follow-up imaging, which for sarcomas usually involves an MRI of the thigh and a CT scan of your chest to check for any distant spread, as lungs are a common site for sarcoma metastases.\nJohn: More scans? I feel like I live in those machines.\nClinician: I understand, but it's crucial for monitoring. Sarcomas can recur, so regular surveillance is key to catching anything early.

The last notes indicate 'Drug or chemical induced diabetes mellitus with neurological complications with diabetic mononeuropathy'. Can you tell me which drug was thought to cause this, and what neurological symptoms you're having?\nJohn: Well, Doctor, I was on high-dose steroids for a long time for another condition, and they said that probably brought on the diabetes. As for the nerve problems, I've had this pain and numbness in my right foot, mostly around the big toe, for a while now.\nClinician: Steroid-induced diabetes is common with prolonged high doses. Are you still on steroids, or have they been tapered?\nJohn: They've been tapered down, but I'm still on a low dose.\nClinician: And the foot pain and numbness – has it been investigated? Does it affect your walking or balance?\nJohn: It can be quite painful at times, like burning or pins and needles. Sometimes it makes it hard to feel where my foot is properly. I haven't had any specific tests for it yet.\nClinician: (Performs neurological and foot exam) You have decreased sensation to monofilament testing over the dorsum of your right big toe and some weakness of big toe extension. This is consistent with a mononeuropathy, possibly affecting the deep peroneal nerve or a branch. This could be related to your diabetes. We need to get your blood sugars under better control to prevent further nerve damage. What are your recent sugar readings like? And are you on medication for the diabetes?\nJohn: My sugars are often high, over 200. I'm on Metformin, but that's it.\nClinician: Okay. We need to intensify your diabetes treatment. We'll add another oral medication, perhaps a sulfonylurea or a DPP-4 inhibitor, and stress the importance of diet and exercise. For the foot, I'll refer you for nerve conduction studies (NCS/EMG) to better characterize the neuropathy. We can also try medication like Gabapentin or Pregabalin for the nerve pain.",

Even without a positive rheumatoid factor, your symptoms and joint involvement are very suggestive of an inflammatory arthritis, likely seronegative rheumatoid arthritis.

Rheumatoid arthritis can cause inflammation not just in the joints but sometimes in the muscles around them, leading to myopathy or weakness. We need to manage the RA aggressively. Are you currently on any DMARDs like Methotrexate?\nBrenda: No, just ibuprofen when the pain is bad.\nClinician: Given the active inflammation, muscle weakness, and impact on your function, we really need to start a DMARD. This will help control the underlying disease process, reduce the inflammation in both your joints and potentially the muscles, and prevent further damage. I'll refer you to a rheumatologist as well for their expertise in managing RA and its complications like myopathy.\nBrenda: So, more medication and another specialist?\nClinician: Yes, it's the best approach for managing active rheumatoid arthritis effectively.",

It appears there's a significant error in the electronic record for today's visit reason. Let's disregard that completely. What actually brought you in today?\nJoseph: (Chuckles) No problem, Doctor. I was wondering about that one. I'm actually here because I've been having this pain in my upper right belly, under my ribs. It's been on and off for a few months, but it's worse after I eat, especially if it's something greasy.\nClinician: I see. Any nausea, vomiting, or fever with this pain?\nJoseph: Some nausea, yes, particularly after those fatty meals. No fever or vomiting. Maybe my urine has been a bit darker than usual.\nClinician: Okay, Joseph. Pain in that area, especially after fatty foods, can often be related to your gallbladder, possibly gallstones. We should investigate that. I'll order an ultrasound of your abdomen to get a good look at your gallbladder, liver, and bile ducts. We'll also do some blood tests to check your liver function and enzymes like lipase to rule out pancreatitis.\nJoseph: Gallstones? My sister had those.\nClinician: It can run in families. The ultrasound is a very good and non-invasive first step to check for that. In the meantime, try to stick to a lower-fat diet and see if that helps your symptoms at all.\nJoseph: I can try that.

We are following up on your rheumatoid arthritis, which primarily affects your left hand according to your chart: 'Rheumatoid arthritis with rheumatoid factor of left hand without organ or systems involvement'. How have you been?\nAndrew: It's still pretty bothersome, Doctor. My knuckles and fingers on my left hand get very stiff, especially when I wake up, and it's painful to make a fist or grip things. It makes daily tasks difficult.\nClinician: And are you currently taking any specific medication for the rheumatoid arthritis, other than for pain relief?\nAndrew: Just ibuprofen when it's really bad. It helps a little, but not for long.\nClinician: (Examines hands) Yes, I can see there's some swelling and tenderness in several of your finger joints on the left hand. Given that this is persistent and impacting your function, and your rheumatoid factor is positive, we really need to consider starting a Disease-Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drug, or DMARD. These medications treat the underlying inflammation, not just the symptoms. Methotrexate is often the first one we try.\nAndrew: I've heard of that. Does it have a lot of side effects?\nClinician: We start with a low dose and monitor you closely with blood tests for any side effects on your liver or blood counts. We also prescribe folic acid, which helps reduce some of the common side effects. The goal is to get your arthritis under control, reduce pain and swelling, and prevent long-term damage to your joints.

My old doctor used to do a chest X-ray every so often.\nClinician: That's a significant smoking history, and it does put you at higher risk for lung cancer.

Finding lung cancer early, when it's smaller and hasn't spread, gives the best chance for successful treatment. There are also some potential downsides to screening, like the chance of finding small nodules that turn out to be benign but might require further tests or follow-up scans, which can cause some anxiety.\nBetty: I see.

You'll continue to have regular follow-ups and blood tests with your hematologist.\nBetty: That's such a relief. What's next?\nClinician: Your hematologist will guide the long-term plan, which might involve continued monitoring or perhaps some form of maintenance therapy if they feel it's indicated.

This is very typical for trochanteric bursitis, which is inflammation of the bursa sac there. Sometimes it's related to how you walk or if muscles are weak, and sometimes it just flares up.

We could also try a course of stronger oral anti-inflammatories, or a referral to physiotherapy for exercises to help strengthen the area and prevent it from coming back.\nBetty: I think I'd like to try the injection again if it worked so well last time.

The previous note mentioned you were starting to experience more fatigue and had some swollen glands, and we were referring you to hematology.\nDennis: Yes, Doctor. I saw the hematologist, Dr. Blood. They did some more tests, including a bone marrow biopsy, and confirmed it's early-stage CLL. They said for now, we're going with a 'watch and wait' approach as my blood counts aren't too bad yet and I don't have severe symptoms, just the fatigue and some swollen nodes.\nClinician: That's a very common approach for early-stage, asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic CLL. So, no active treatment like chemotherapy started yet?\nDennis: No, not yet. They said we'll monitor my blood counts every few months.\nClinician: That sounds appropriate. How has the fatigue been lately? And the swollen glands?\nDennis: The fatigue is still there, some days worse than others. The glands haven't really changed much, maybe a bit smaller since I last saw you.\nClinician: (Performs exam) Your lymph nodes are still palpable but perhaps slightly smaller, and your spleen tip is just palpable. Your bloodwork from last week shows your lymphocyte count is still elevated but stable compared to three months ago. Hemoglobin and platelets are okay. So, we'll continue the 'watch and wait' approach as per hematology.

Can you tell me a bit more about that and how you're doing?\nBrenda: Doctor, I was on pain pills for my back for a long time, and I got dependent on them. I've been going to a program, and I haven't used any unprescribed opioids for about three months now. I'm on Suboxone.\nClinician: That's wonderful progress, Brenda. Three months is a significant milestone. How are you finding the Suboxone treatment? Is it helping with cravings and withdrawal?\nBrenda: Yes, it's helped a lot. I don't have those terrible cravings anymore, and I feel much more stable. My biggest challenge now is just dealing with the day-to-day stresses without wanting to use.\nClinician: That's a very common part of recovery. Are you also involved in counseling or support groups as part of your Suboxone program?\nBrenda: Yes, I have a weekly counseling session and I go to NA meetings.\nClinician: Excellent. That combination of medication-assisted treatment and psychosocial support is the most effective approach. Today, we'll do a general check-in, see how you're tolerating the Suboxone, make sure there are no side effects, and discuss any challenges you're facing. We also need to ensure your other health needs are being met. Have you had a recent physical or any routine screenings?\nBrenda: Not in a while, I've been focused on this.",

It seems unusual for someone without a prior diabetes diagnosis to have hypoglycemia from a drug unless it's a diabetes medication itself.\nAmy: (Confused) Diabetes? Hypoglycemia? Doctor, I don't have diabetes, and I don't think I've ever had problems with low blood sugar. I was here last because I was having really bad panic attacks and was worried about some medication I had stopped taking... I think it was a painkiller I got dependent on.\nClinician: I am so sorry, Amy. It seems there's another significant error in the notes I was reviewing from your previous encounter. Thank you for clarifying. So, you are here for follow-up on anxiety and panic symptoms after stopping a pain medication?\nAmy: Yes. The anxiety is still pretty bad, and I've had a couple of panic attacks since I last saw you. The Hydroxyzine helps a bit when it's really bad, but I feel on edge a lot.\nClinician: It's very common for anxiety to be heightened after discontinuing a medication you've become dependent on. You mentioned you started therapy. How is that going?\nAmy: It's helpful to talk, but the physical symptoms of anxiety are hard to manage.\nClinician: I understand. Since the Hydroxyzine is only providing partial relief for acute episodes, and your anxiety is persistent, we should discuss starting a daily medication that can help reduce the overall level of anxiety and prevent panic attacks. An SSRI like Sertraline or Escitalopram could be a good option. They are not addictive and are effective for anxiety disorders.\nAmy: Would that help with the panic attacks too?\nClinician: Yes, they are often very effective for panic disorder as well. We would start at a low dose and gradually increase it. It takes a few weeks to see the full benefit. What are your thoughts on that?",

They can perform venom testing to confirm the specific allergy and discuss the possibility of venom immunotherapy. These are a series of allergy shots that can greatly reduce or even eliminate your risk of having another severe reaction if you are stung again.\nAmy: Really?

It's been getting worse after I eat fatty foods, and sometimes I feel a bit nauseous.\nClinician: How long has this been going on, Joseph?\nJoseph: A few months now, on and off, but more persistent lately.\nClinician: Any fever, vomiting, or changes in your stool or urine color?\nJoseph: No fever. My urine might be a little darker than usual, but my stools seem normal.\nClinician: Okay. This sounds like it could be related to your gallbladder, possibly gallstones. We'll need to do an abdominal ultrasound to check that. I'll also order some blood tests for your liver function and pancreas enzymes. In the meantime, try to avoid very fatty meals.\nJoseph: Gallstones? My dad had those. Is it serious?\nClinician: It can be painful, but it's usually very treatable.

Are you still taking the Donepezil?\nAndrew: Yes, but I don't know if it helps anymore.\nClinician: With advanced Alzheimer's, the benefits of medications like Donepezil can become less apparent as the disease progresses.

Can you tell me why you're interested in this screening today?\nBetty: My father died of lung cancer, and I smoked for about 10 years when I was younger, though I quit a long time ago, maybe 20 years.\nClinician: Thank you for that information, Betty. A family history of lung cancer and a personal smoking history are important risk factors. Current guidelines for lung cancer screening with a low-dose CT scan are for adults aged 50 to 80 who have at least a 20 pack-year smoking history (that's packs per day multiplied by years smoked) and currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years. Based on a 10-year smoking history, even if it was a pack a day, you might not meet the pack-year criteria for routine LDCT screening, and quitting 20 years ago also puts you outside the 15-year window.\nBetty: Oh, so I don't need it then?\nClinician: Not necessarily as a routine annual screening based on current guidelines. However, given your family history, if you have any new or persistent respiratory symptoms like a chronic cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, or unexplained weight loss, then we would definitely investigate those further, possibly with imaging. Do you have any such symptoms currently?\nBetty: No, I feel pretty well, actually.\nClinician: That's good.

That's typical for trochanteric bursitis. Since you had such a good and prolonged response to the injection before, that's certainly a good option to consider again. Other options include a course of oral anti-inflammatory medication, or physiotherapy to work on hip strength and flexibility, which might help prevent recurrences.\nBetty: The injection worked so well last time, I think I'd prefer to try that again if possible.\nClinician: Okay. If you're comfortable, we can do the corticosteroid injection for your right trochanteric bursitis today. It should help settle down this inflammation again.\nBetty: Yes, please.",

I've never worked with flax. I'm here because I've been having trouble with my asthma lately.\nClinician: My apologies, Paul! It seems there's an error in the previous diagnosis listed. Let's correct that. So you're here because your asthma has been acting up?\nPaul: Yes. My usual inhaler, the blue one, isn't helping as much, and I'm waking up at night coughing and wheezing a couple of times a week.\nClinician: How long has this been going on? And any new triggers you've noticed?\nPaul: For about two or three weeks. I did have a bit of a cold recently, and it seems to have set off my asthma.\nClinician: (Listens to lungs) I can hear some expiratory wheezing throughout your lungs today. Your peak flow is also a bit lower than your usual best. This does sound like an asthma exacerbation, likely triggered by your recent cold. We need to step up your treatment. I'm going to prescribe a short course of oral steroids, Prednisone, to get the inflammation down quickly. We also need to review your maintenance inhaler. Are you using a daily controller inhaler?\nPaul: I have one, a brown one, but I admit I haven't been using it regularly, just the blue one when I feel tight.\nClinician: Ah, that's key, Paul. The controller inhaler needs to be used every day to prevent these flare-ups. Let's restart that properly and ensure your technique is correct.",

How has your shoulder been, and are you taking medication for gout?\nRaymond: The shoulder has actually been okay lately, Doctor. It was my big toe that was really bad a few weeks ago – red, swollen, incredibly painful. That's what made me come in then. I haven't had any shoulder problems for a while.\nClinician: Ah, I see. So the main issue with gout has been your toe, a classic podagra. And are you on Allopurinol or something similar to lower your uric acid?\nRaymond: No, I haven't taken anything like that for years.\nClinician: And how is your kidney function? The 'renal impairment' part of that diagnosis.\nRaymond: I think they said it was a bit down, but not terrible.\nClinician: (Reviews labs if available, or plans to order). Okay. Recurrent gout attacks, especially if your kidney function isn't optimal for clearing uric acid, really warrant long-term urate-lowering therapy like Allopurinol. This helps prevent future attacks and potential joint damage. We need to check your current uric acid level and kidney function. If your uric acid is high, we should start Allopurinol, adjusting the dose for your kidney function.\nRaymond: So, pills every day?\nClinician: Yes, to keep the uric acid levels down consistently. For an acute attack in your toe, we'd use anti-inflammatories or colchicine, but the Allopurinol is for prevention.",
