Let me take a look. (Examines mouth) It looks like your wisdom tooth is impacted and causing some inflammation. We call this pericoronitis.\nLaura: Oh, is that serious?\nDoctor: It can be quite uncomfortable and lead to infection if not treated. I'll prescribe some antibiotics and pain relief for now, and we'll need to get an X-ray to see its exact position. Then we can discuss options for removing the tooth.",
