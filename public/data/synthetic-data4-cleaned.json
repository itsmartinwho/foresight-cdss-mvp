Some days are better than others. The fatigue is still quite persistent, and my hands and knees have been particularly achy this past month, especially in the mornings.\nDoctor: I understand, Bob. We're managing your Rheumatoid Arthritis, and these flare-ups can happen. Have you noticed any new joints becoming swollen or tender?\nBob: My right wrist has been a bit swollen, and the stiffness in my hands in the morning seems to last longer now, maybe an hour or so.\nDoctor: Okay. And are the current medications providing any relief for the pain and stiffness?\nBob: The methotrexate helps generally, but these last few weeks, it feels less effective for these flare-ups. The pain is about a 6 out of 10 on bad days.\nDoctor: We may need to adjust your treatment plan.

Sometimes when I stand up too quickly, or if I turn my head suddenly, the room starts to spin for a little while. And I just don't feel as steady on my feet as I used to.\nDoctor: I see.

Or any hearing changes or ringing in your ears?\nEleanor: Sometimes a little bit of nausea, but no changes to my hearing or ringing. My daughter is worried I might fall.\nDoctor: That's a valid concern. We'll certainly look into this. We'll do a few tests today, including checking your blood pressure lying and standing, and some balance tests. Depending on what we find, we might consider a referral.
