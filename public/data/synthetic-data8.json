My eyes are still really red, and it feels like there's sand in them all the time. My vision is a bit blurry too, especially in bright light.\nDoctor: I'm sorry to hear that's still bothering you, Justin. Let's take a look. (Performs eye exam with slit lamp and fluorescein stain). Yes, I can see there's still quite a bit of inflammation and some scarring on the surface of both corneas. What's concerning is that I'm seeing some new blood vessels starting to grow into the clear part of your eye, the cornea. That's what we call neovascularization, and it's a response to the injury, but we need to manage it to prevent further vision problems.\nJustin: New blood vessels? Is that bad?\nDoctor: It's something we need to treat, Justin. It can cause more clouding if it progresses. I'm going to prescribe some steroid eye drops to help reduce the inflammation and hopefully stop these vessels from growing further. We'll also continue with plenty of lubricating drops. I'll also want you to see an ophthalmologist for a more specialized assessment. \nJustin: Okay, Doctor. Steroid drops and an eye specialist. Got it.",

That sounds like the peripheral angiopathy we've discussed, where the blood flow to your legs is reduced due to diabetes. Are you checking your feet daily for any sores or changes?\nAlexander: I try to, yes. No open sores, thankfully.\nDoctor: That's very important. Your blood sugars, how have they been?\nAlexander: Mostly in the 150s to 180s. I know it's not perfect.\nDoctor: We do need to work on getting those numbers down, Alexander, as better sugar control can help slow the progression of these complications. Your A1c today is 8.2%.

You mentioned when you scheduled this appointment that you're experiencing some increasing weakness and unusual sensations in your arms and legs?\nAlexander: Yes, Doctor. It's been going on for months, but it's definitely getting worse. My hands feel clumsy, I drop things. And my legs... they just feel heavy, and I'm tripping more. Plus this constant tingling, like my feet are always asleep.\nDoctor: I'm sorry to hear it's progressing, Alexander. Have you noticed it more on one side than the other, or is it fairly symmetrical?\nAlexander: It's pretty much both sides, maybe a bit worse on my right. It's the clumsiness and the weakness that's really bothering me. I used to enjoy woodworking, but I can't grip the tools properly anymore.\nDoctor: That must be very frustrating. We did some initial nerve tests last time that were abnormal. Given the progressive nature and the symmetry of your symptoms – the weakness and sensory changes – we need to consider conditions like Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy, or CIDP. This is an autoimmune condition where your body attacks the myelin sheath around your nerves. I'd like to refer you to a neurologist for further specialized testing, which might include more detailed nerve conduction studies, an EMG, and possibly a lumbar puncture or even a nerve biopsy to confirm the diagnosis.\nAlexander: CIDP? I've never heard of it. Is there treatment?\nDoctor: Yes, Alexander, there are treatments for CIDP, such as corticosteroids, IVIG, or plasma exchange, which can be very effective in managing the condition and improving symptoms. The neurologist will be able to determine the best course of action once we have a definitive diagnosis.",

It's been getting progressively worse over the last few weeks. The usual ache from my arthritis is there, but now there's this deeper, more constant pain, and it feels swollen and warm.\nDoctor: I'm sorry to hear that. You have a history of rheumatoid arthritis, correct? And you take methotrexate for that?\nPamela: Yes, that's right. For many years now.\nDoctor: Sometimes, rheumatoid arthritis can cause inflammation of the blood vessels, which we call vasculitis. This can affect various parts of the body, including the joints, and cause more severe pain or new symptoms. Given the warmth and increased swelling you're describing in one specific joint, we need to consider this. Are you having any skin rashes, fevers, or unusual numbness anywhere?\nPamela: No rashes or fevers. Maybe a bit more tingling in my fingers lately, but I thought that was just the arthritis.\nDoctor: We'll need to run some blood tests to check your inflammatory markers and possibly an ultrasound or MRI of your hip to get a better look. We should also consult with your rheumatologist about this flare.",

Acute flare of Rheumatoid Arthritis affecting right hip. 2.

Blood cultures if fever develops or suspicion for infection increases. 2. Imaging: Ultrasound of R hip to assess for effusion/synovitis, consider MRI if ultrasound inconclusive or further detail needed. 3. Start Prednisone 20mg PO daily for 5 days, then taper, for acute flare. 4.

We're here to discuss the MRI of your brain that we ordered because of those persistent headaches and some visual changes you mentioned.\nPamela: Yes, I've been worried about what it might show.\nDoctor: The MRI shows a small mass in your pituitary gland area, Pamela. It's about 1.2 centimeters. Given its appearance, it's likely a benign neoplasm, often called a pituitary adenoma. These are usually not cancerous, but they can cause symptoms by pressing on nearby structures or by producing hormones.\nPamela: A tumor in my brain? Even if it's benign, that sounds scary.\nDoctor: I understand it sounds alarming. Many of these are slow-growing and can be managed effectively. Your headaches and visual field disturbances could be related to this. We need to do some more tests, including blood work to check your hormone levels, as pituitary adenomas can sometimes overproduce certain hormones. I'm also going to refer you to an endocrinologist and a neurosurgeon who specialize in pituitary tumors to discuss the findings and treatment options. Sometimes these are just monitored, sometimes medication can help, and sometimes surgery is needed if it's causing significant problems or is large.\nPamela: So, more specialists and tests.\nDoctor: Yes, it's the best way to get a complete picture and plan the best care for you, Pamela.",

I've lost some weight without trying, and my belly feels full and uncomfortable on the left side.\nDoctor: I see. And you were diagnosed with CML, BCR/ABL-positive, and had been in remission on imatinib, is that correct?\nKenneth: That's right. I've been taking the imatinib, haven't missed doses.\nDoctor: Okay. The symptoms you're describing – the fatigue, weight loss, and the fullness in your abdomen which could be your spleen enlarging – are concerning for a relapse of your CML, Kenneth. We need to do some blood tests today, specifically a CBC with differential to look at your white cell counts and for any immature cells, and a quantitative BCR-ABL PCR to check the leukemia levels. Depending on these results, we may need to consider a bone marrow biopsy again and discuss changes to your treatment, possibly switching to a different TKI or other options.\nKenneth: I was afraid of this. I thought the imatinib was keeping it away for good.\nDoctor: Imatinib is very effective, but sometimes the leukemia can develop resistance or recur.

I've been trying to stick to the diet, but it's tough.\nDoctor: I understand it's challenging. Your latest labs show your eGFR is now 25, so your kidney function is unfortunately still declining, and you are firmly in Stage 4, approaching Stage 5. Your creatinine is up to 3.2. We really need to start seriously discussing options for renal replacement therapy, which means dialysis or a kidney transplant.\nKenneth: Dialysis... I was hoping it wouldn't come to that. Are there any other options?\nDoctor: At this stage, with an eGFR of 25, conservative management alone becomes less effective in managing the complications of kidney failure. We need to prepare you for what's likely ahead. I'd like to refer you to our kidney transplant team for an initial evaluation, and also to our dialysis education program so you can learn about the different types of dialysis – hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis – and what they involve.\nKenneth: That's a lot to take in, Doctor.\nDoctor: It is, Kenneth, and we'll go through it step by step. The education program will help you understand the processes, and the transplant team can assess if you're a candidate for a transplant, which is the best long-term solution if possible.

I do a bit of gardening, some pruning of bushes overhead. Maybe that did it?\nDoctor: That's possible. Does it hurt at night, or if you lie on that shoulder?\nKenneth: Yes, it can ache at night, makes it hard to find a comfortable position.\nDoctor: Okay, Kenneth. I'm going to examine your shoulder. We'll check the range of motion and see if we can pinpoint where the pain is coming from. It could be something like tendinitis, possibly with some calcium deposits, or a rotator cuff issue.
